<IMG alt="VerySimple Organizer: Calendar View" src  ="images/screenshot.gif" align=right border=0 > 

<FONT face=Arial size=2>VerySimple 
Organizer is a set of four scripts: <STRONG>calendar.pl</STRONG>, 
<STRONG>contacts.pl</STRONG>, <STRONG>tasks.pl</STRONG>
and new in version 2.0 <STRONG>inbox.pl</STRONG>
      .&nbsp;&nbsp;Together they&nbsp;can be used as 
a standard personal or workgroup organizer.&nbsp; The functionality is similar to online services such 
as MSN and Yahoo,&nbsp;and windows applications like MS Outlook or Lotus Notes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>     These scripts are&nbsp;much simpler than 
any of the above mentioned programs.&nbsp; However, they can still be very 
useful when you need to share&nbsp;information with a small group of 
people.&nbsp; You&nbsp;could use it for a social club, work team or whatever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2> All three scripts are easy to&nbsp;install and 
customize.&nbsp; Color and layout settings&nbsp;can be changed using&nbsp;the 
browser-based setup program.&nbsp; You can also add, remove or change the field 
names to suit your needs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><U>Limitations:</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If you plan to use this script in a multi-user environment,
you will want to enable file locking.  This is done in the setup screen.  The
setup field is called UseFileLocking and you will want to change the value from
a 0 to a 1
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The 
datafile size may be a consideration.&nbsp; I have 
used these programs to edit datafiles of over 15,000 records without a noticable 
slowdown.&nbsp; Depending on your server and the number of users, you may 
have different results.&nbsp; If you do use this software for something 
important, I'd recommend creating backup copies&nbsp;of your datafiles 
regularly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><B>About 500 Server Errors</B>: Before you post 
a message or inquire about a 500 server error, you will need more information. A 
500 server error is not enough information to troubleshoot your problem. It 
basically means that the web server has no idea what went wrong, so it didn't 
display the page. To see what the problem is, you need to see what the 
<I>real</I>           
    error message is. There are two ways to find the 
real error message: check the server error logs, or run the script 
from the command line.&nbsp; The location of your server error 
logs depends on your server configuration. </FONT></FONT></P>

  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>You will need to know the

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><U>Configuring and Customizing The 
Scripts</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Each of the 
three scripts can be configured through your browser.&nbsp; They get their 
configuration settings from the files calendar.cfg,contacts.cfg 
and&nbsp;tasks.cfg.&nbsp; These files are simply tab-delimited files containing 
the settings.&nbsp; You could edit them using a spreadsheet program such as MS 
Excel, or even a text editor such as NotePad.&nbsp; However, the program 
<STRONG>setup.pl</STRONG>         
          
      
           
             
     was also included along with the 
other scripts.&nbsp; This program can be used to edit the 
configuration&nbsp;files easily&nbsp;though your browser.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>When you open setup.pl in your browser, you'll see a 
link to each of the three configuration files.&nbsp; They all have similar 
settings having to do with colors, the script title, etc.&nbsp; The fields are 
fairly self explainatory and you can play with them to see how they effect the 
look of the scripts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>These fields below affect the functionality of the 
scripts, so you will want to be more careful when editing them:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>FileName:</STRONG> This is the file that is used for 
storing the data.&nbsp; This file must be readable/writeable.&nbsp; The script 
will look for this file relative to the directory in which it is 
installed.&nbsp; So, it is not necessary to have the datafile in the same 
directory, however, you will have to use a relative path (ex: 
../../datafiles/tasks.tab).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>Delimiter:</STRONG> This is the delimiter character that is 
used for the datafile.&nbsp; By default all scripts use a tab character.&nbsp; 
If you have an existing datafile that you want to use that uses a different 
delimiter character, you can change it here in setup.&nbsp; It is recommended 
that you do not change this field.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>ShowFields:</STRONG>      Contacts.pl 
and tasks.pl have a "table view" and a "detail view".&nbsp; The table 
view displays a few fields for&nbsp;all of the records, while the detail view shows 
all fields for only one record.&nbsp; You can customize which fields will show 
on the table view by specifying the fieldnames here.&nbsp; Separate fieldnames 
with a comma&nbsp;(no spaces).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>UseFileLocking:</STRONG> Enter a 1 or a 0 
here if you enable or disable file locking.&nbsp; File locking prevents problems 
when more than one person is accessing a file at the same time.&nbsp; If you 
have more than one person using the scripts at once, it is recommended that you 
enable file locking.&nbsp; If you do this, the directory in which the .tab files 
are located must be writable by the script.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<STRONG><U>Special Setup For Inbox:</U></STRONG></P>
<p>
The first thing to mention about inbox.pl is that this is a BETA version and it
does not function all that well.  I'm including it just because it completes what
you would normally expect from an organizer type software.  This is my first
stab at an email client, and to be honest, I don't have major plans to do much
with it because it requires a bit of specialized expertise to make a good email client and
I'm just not that interested in it!  My plan is to find a better email client that is
already written and bundle it with organizer.  If you have an email client that
you would like to share, please contact me.
<p>
With that said, the inbox script relies on several Perl modules to function correctly.
It is likely that you will recieve an error about missing modules when you first try
to run it.  Check the system requirements section above to see what modules you
need.
<p>
Once you have the modules required, you can configure inbox using the setup utility
as all the other scripts.  You need to set PopServer, PopUserId in order to read
your mail.  If you plan to send messages, then PopEmail and either SmtpServer or SendmailPath
will need to be configured as well.  The EncryptKey field is the encryption key used to encrypt your password
cookie file, so it is not stored as plain-text on your machine.  This can be any random word.
The TempDir is a read/write directory on your server that the app can use to create temp files.

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><U>Advanced Customizing (Altering the 
database fields):</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>All three of the organizer scripts were written to track 
all of the information that you require.&nbsp; It may turn out that you need 
to store additional information about a task, such as the last updated date, 
progress status, or whatever.&nbsp; I</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>f you want to add an 
additional field, or remove an existing one, all you have to do is open the datafile using 
a spreadsheet or text editor program.&nbsp; The first line of the file are all of 
the fieldnames.&nbsp; They are separated by a tab character.&nbsp; You can delete existing 
fields, or add new ones by simply deleting or adding another 
field name separated by tab characters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As long as you do not delete the fields labeled "ID", 
"COMPLETED"&nbsp;or "DATE" you can make any changes that you like to the 
columns.&nbsp; You can add or remove columns as you require.&nbsp; Keep in mind 
that you cannot change the number of fields without also updating the 
data.&nbsp; For that reason it is best if you make any customizations before you 
enter any data into the system.&nbsp; Otherwise you will have to open the 
datafile using&nbsp;a spreadsheet program and then export it.</FONT></P><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><U>Security 
Considerations:</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The organizer scripts have no built-in 
security.&nbsp; If you are installing the script on a public server, it is 
recommended that you use whatever security mechanisms are available through the 
server.&nbsp; Unix/Apache normally controls security through .htaccess files and 
a password file.&nbsp; Windows/IIS Servers use the IIS Management Console, or 
the NTFS permissions.&nbsp; If you are on a virtual host, they may provide a 
web-based utility for this purpose.</FONT></P>
<P>Password protecting the entire installation directory is sufficient if you 
are the only person using the script, or you know everyone who will be using the 
script.&nbsp; For extra security, to prevent people from&nbsp;downloading your 
datafiles, it is recommended that you put further security on the "data" 
subdirectory so that it cannot be browsed.&nbsp; The data directory comes with 
an .htaccess file that will prevent people from accessing those file if you are 
on an Apache server.</P></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG><U>Troubleshooting:</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><FONT size=2><STRONG>Error: Can't call method "Open" without a package or object reference 
at ...</STRONG> - This error occurs for one of three reasons.&nbsp; 1. 
The datafile was not found.&nbsp; 2. The datafile is not readable or 3. The 
datafile is not writable.&nbsp; If you only get this error only when you try to 
add or update a record, then 3 is the reason.&nbsp; The file is not 
writable.&nbsp; If you get this error when simply trying to look at a record, or 
open the script, then you'll know it's either 1 or 2.&nbsp; Double check that 
the file is where it should be, and that the web browser has permission to read 
it.</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>The script stalls for several seconds, then gives a 
warning&nbsp;about&nbsp;locking the file:</STRONG> This happens when the 
directory in which the .tab files are located is not writable by the 
web&nbsp;server account.&nbsp; The file-locking mechanism creates a "lock" 
file&nbsp;in the directory, so write permission on the file alone is not sufficient.&nbsp; 
You must allow write permission&nbsp;for the&nbsp;entire directory.&nbsp; 
If you are unable to do this, then you&nbsp;can still use the script, 
however file locking cannot be used.&nbsp; You can enable/disable&nbsp;file-locking in Setup.</FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>The script produces no output, or writes only half
of the page:</STRONG> different servers respond differently to the Perl buffering feature.
You can experiment with this by editing this line in each script: <b>$| = 1;</b>  This is commented
out by default, but you can remove the comment to enable buffering.  Try this both ways
to see what works best on your server.
