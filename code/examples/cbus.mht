# This file is an example MHT file for the Clipsal CBus module, providing
# just a definition of the CGate interface. When MisterHouse runs with a valid
# CGate definition, but no other CBus objects defined, it will query the
# CBus network for known objects and units, and write a corresponding
# MHT file including their definitions.
