=head1 B<Insteon::IOLinc>

=head2 SYNOPSIS

In user code:

    use Insteon::IOLinc;
    $io_device = new Insteon::IOLinc('12.34.56',$myPLM);

In items.mht:

    INSTEON_IOLINC, 12.34.56, io_device, io_group

Turning on a relay:

    $io_device->set('on');

Turning off a relay:

    $io_device->set('off');

Requesting sensor status: 

    $io_device->request_sensor_status();

Print the Current Device Settings to the log:

    $io_device->get_operating_flag();

=head2 DESCRIPTION

Support for the Insteon IOLinc.

The IOLinc is a strange device in that commands sent to it control one aspect
of the device, but commands received from it are from another aspect of the
device.

=head3 LINKING

As a result of the IOLinc's oddities, when the IOLinc is set as a controller
of another device, that other device will be controlled by the sensor state.
However, when the IOLinc is set as a responder in a link, the relay of the
IOLinc will change with the commands sent by the controller.

=head3 STATE REPORTED IN MisterHouse

MisterHouse objects are only designed to hold the state of a single aspect.  As a 
result of the IOLinc's oddities, the $io_device defined using the examples above
will track the state of the relay only.  The state of the sensor can be obtained
using the C<request_sensor_status()> command.

One more oddity is that using the "set" button on the side of the device to 
change the state of the relay, will cause MH to perceive this as a change in 
the state of the sensor, thus placing the sensor and relay objects out of sync.

=head3 SENSOR STATE CHILD OBJECT

To create a device that directly tracks the state of the sensor, you can use 
C<Insteon::IOLinc_sensor>.  The state of the child object will reflect the state 
of the sensor and it will be automatically updated as long as the IOLinc is 
linked to the 

However, if you want to directly link an obect to the sensor 
be sure to use the normal SCENE_MEMBER code in your mht file with the IOLinc
defined as the controller.

Instructions for this object are contained in C<Insteon::IOLinc_sensor>.

=head2 NOTES

This module works with the Insteon IOLinc device from Smarthome.  The EZIO device
uses a different set of commands and this code will offer only limited, if any
support at all, for EZIO devices.

The state that the relay is in when the device is linked to the PLM matters if
you are using relay mode Momentary_A.

=head2 BUGS

The relay state will not be accurate if you are using a momentary mode.
