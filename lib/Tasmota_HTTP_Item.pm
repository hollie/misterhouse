This module currently supports Tasmota switch and fan type devices but other
devices can be added with extra packages

Requirements:

  The Tasmota device needs to be setup with a rule to send HTTP requests to MH
  if two-way communication is desired.  For example, a Sonoff Mini switch input
  can be sent to MH with the rule:
  Rule1 ON Power1#State DO WebSend [192.168.0.1:80] /SET;none?select_item=Kitchen_Light&select_state=%value% ENDON

Setup:

In your code define Tasmota_HTTP::Things in an MHT:

  TASMOTA_HTTP_SWITCH,   192.168.x.y,   Kitchen_Light,   POWER1,   Kitchen

Or in a code file:

 $Kitchen_Light = new Tasmota_HTTP::Switch("192.168.x.y", "POWER1");
 Where:
   192.168.x.y is the IPv4 address or hostname of the Tasmota device
   POWER1 is the name of the Tasmota output to control (POWER1 if not specified)

 $Kitchen_Light->set(ON);
