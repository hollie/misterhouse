=head1 NAME

Text::LevenshteinXS - An XS implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Text::LevenshteinXS qw(distance);

 print distance("foo","four");
 # prints "2"

 print distance("foo","bar");
 # prints "3"


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the Levenshtein edit distance in a XS way.

The Levenshtein edit distance is a measure of the degree of proximity between two strings.
This distance is the number of substitutions, deletions or insertions ("edits") 
needed to transform one string into the other one (and vice versa).
When two strings have distance 0, they are the same.
A good point to start is: <http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm>
