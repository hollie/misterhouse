=head1  NAME

B<Chatbot::Eliza> - A clone of the classic Eliza program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Chatbot::Eliza;
  # see below for details

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the classic Eliza algorithm. 
The original Eliza program was written by Joseph 
Weizenbaum and described in the Communications 
of the ACM in 1966.  Eliza is a mock Rogerian 
psychotherapist.  It prompts for user input, 
and uses a simple transformation algorithm
to change user input into a follow-up question.  
The program is designed to give the appearance 
of understanding.  

This program is a faithful implementation of the program 
described by Weizenbaum.  It uses a simplified script 
language (devised by Charles Hayden).  The content 
of the script is the same as Weizenbaum's. 

This module encapsulates the Eliza algorithm 
in the form of an object.  This should make 
the functionality easy to incorporate in larger programs.  

The current version of Chatbot::Eliza.pm is available on CPAN:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Chatbot/


=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this package, just change to the directory which 
you created by untarring the package, and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make
	make install

This will copy Eliza.pm to your perl library directory for 
use by all perl scripts.  You probably must be root to do this,
unless you have installed a personal copy of perl.  


=head1 USAGE

This is all you need to do to launch a simple
Eliza session:

	use Chatbot::Eliza;

	$mybot = new Chatbot::Eliza;
	$mybot->command_interface;

You can also customize certain features of the 
session:

	$myotherbot = new Chatbot::Eliza;

	$myotherbot->name( "Hortense" );
	$myotherbot->debug( 1 );

	$myotherbot->command_interface;

These lines set the name of the bot to be
"Hortense" and turn on the debugging output.

When creating an Eliza object, you can specify
a name and an alternative scriptfile:

	$bot = new Chatbot::Eliza "Brian", "myscript.txt";

You can also use an anonymous hash to set these parameters.
Any of the fields can be initialized using this syntax:

	$bot = new Chatbot::Eliza {
		name       => "Brian", 
		scriptfile => "myscript.txt",
		debug      => 1,
		prompts_on => 1,
		memory_on  => 0,
		myrand     => sub { rand($_[0]); },
	};

If you don't specify a script file, then the
Eliza module will initialize the new Eliza
object with a default script that the module
contains within itself. 

You can use any of the internal functions in
a calling program.  The code below takes an 
arbitrary string and retrieves the reply from 
the Eliza object:

	my $string = "I have too many problems.";
	my $reply  = $mybot->transform( $string );

You can easily create two bots, each with a different
script, and see how they interact:

	use Chatbot::Eliza

	my ($harry, $sally, $he_says, $she_says);

	$sally = new Chatbot::Eliza "Sally", "histext.txt";
	$harry = new Chatbot::Eliza "Harry", "hertext.txt";

	$he_says  = "I am sad.";

	# Seed the random number generator.
	srand( time ^ ($$ + ($$ << 15)) );      

	while (1) {
		$she_says = $sally->transform( $he_says );
		print $sally->name, ": $she_says \n";
	
		$he_says  = $harry->transform( $she_says );
		print $harry->name, ": $he_says \n";
	}

Mechanically, this works well.  However, it critically depends
on the actual script data.  Having two mock Rogerian therapists
talk to each other usually does not produce any sensible conversation, 
of course.  

After each call to the transform() method, the debugging output
for that transformation is stored in a variable called $debug_text.

	my $reply      = $mybot->transform( "My foot hurts" );
	my $debugging  = $mybot->debug_text;

This feature always available, even if the instance's $debug 
variable is set to 0. 

Calling programs can specify their own random-number generators.
Use this syntax:

        $chatbot = new Chatbot::Eliza;
        $chatbot->myrand(
                sub {
                        #function goes here!
                }
        );

The custom random function should have the same prototype
as perl's built-in rand() function.  That is, it should take
a single (numeric) expression as a parameter, and it should
return a floating-point value between 0 and that number.

What this code actually does is pass a reference to an anonymous
subroutine ("code reference").  Make sure you've read the perlref
manpage for details on how code references actually work. 

If you don't specify any custom rand function, then the Eliza
object will just use the built-in rand() function. 

=head1 MAIN DATA MEMBERS

Each Eliza object uses the following data structures 
to hold the script data in memory:

=head2 %decomplist 

I<Hash>: the set of keywords;  I<Values>: strings containing 
the decomposition rules. 

=head2 %reasmblist 

I<Hash>: a set of values which are each the join 
of a keyword and a corresponding decomposition rule;  
I<Values>: the set of possible reassembly statements 
for that keyword and decomposition rule.  

=head2 %reasmblist_for_memory

This structure is identical to C<%reasmblist>, except
that these rules are only invoked when a user comment 
is being retrieved from memory. These contain comments 
such as "Earlier you mentioned that...," which are only
appropriate for remembered comments.  Rules in the script
must be specially marked in order to be included
in this list rather than C<%reasmblist>. The default
script only has a few of these rules. 

=head2 @memory

A list of user comments which an Eliza instance is remembering 
for future use.  Eliza does not remember everything, only some things. 
In this implementation, Eliza will only remember comments
which match a decomposition rule which actually has reassembly 
rules that are marked with the keyword "reasm_for_memory"
rather than the normal "reasmb".  The default script
only has a few of these.  

=head2 %keyranks

I<Hash>: the set of keywords;  I<Values>: the ranks for each keyword

=head2 @quit

"quit" words -- that is, words the user might use 
to try to exit the program.  

=head2 @initial

Possible greetings for the beginning of the program.

=head2 @final

Possible farewells for the end of the program.

=head2 %pre

I<Hash>: words which are replaced before any transformations;  
I<Values>: the respective replacement words.

=head2 %post

I<Hash>: words which are replaced after the transformations 
and after the reply is constructed;  I<Values>: the respective 
replacement words.

=head2 %synon

I<Hash>: words which are found in decomposition rules;  
I<Values>: words which are treated just like their 
corresponding synonyms during matching of decomposition
rules. 

=head2 Other data members

There are several other internal data members.  Hopefully 
these are sufficiently obvious that you can learn about them
just by reading the source code.

    name       => 'Eliza',
    scriptfile => '',

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

    my $chatterbot = new Chatbot::Eliza;

new() creates a new Eliza object.  This method
also calls the internal _initialize() method, which in turn
calls the parse_script_data() method, which initializes
the script data.  

    my $chatterbot = new Chatbot::Eliza 'Ahmad', 'myfile.txt';

The eliza object defaults to the name "Eliza", and it
contains default script data within itself.  However,
using the syntax above, you can specify an alternative
name and an alternative script file. 

See the method parse_script_data(). for a description
of the format of the script file. 

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $that, $name, $scriptfile ) = @_;
    my $class = ref($that) || $that;
    my $self = {
        _permitted => \%fields,
        %fields,
    };
    bless $self, $class;
    $self->_initialize( $name, $scriptfile );
    return $self;
}    # end method new

sub _initialize {
    my ( $self, $param1, $param2 ) = @_;

    if ( defined $param1 and ref $param1 eq "HASH" ) {

        # Allow the calling program to pass in intial parameters
        # as an anonymous hash
        map { $self->{$_} = $param1->{$_}; } keys %$param1;

        $self->parse_script_data( $self->{scriptfile} );

    }
    else {
        $self->name($param1) if $param1;
        $self->parse_script_data($param2);
    }

    # Initialize the memory array ref at instantiation time,
    # rather than at class definition time.
    # (Thanks to Randal Schwartz and Robert Chin for fixing this bug.)
    #
    $self->{memory} = [];
}

sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $class = ref($self) || croak "$self is not an object : $!\n";
    my $field = $AUTOLOAD;
    $field =~ s/.*://;    # Strip fully-qualified portion

    unless ( exists $self->{"_permitted"}->{$field} ) {
        croak "Can't access `$field' field in object of class $class : $!\n";
    }

    if (@_) {
        return $self->{$field} = shift;
    }
    else {
        return $self->{$field};
    }
}    # end method AUTOLOAD

####################################################################
# --- command_interface ---

=head2 command_interface()

    $chatterbot->command_interface;

command_interface() opens an interactive session with 
the Eliza object, just like the original Eliza program.

If you want to design your own session format, then 
you can write your own while loop and your own functions
for prompting for and reading user input, and use the 
transform() method to generate Eliza's responses. 
(I<Note>: you do not need to invoke preprocess()
and postprocess() directly, because these are invoked
from within the transform() method.) 

But if you're lazy and you want to skip all that,
then just use command_interface().  It's all done for you. 

During an interactive session invoked using command_interface(),
you can enter the word "debug" to toggle debug mode on and off.
You can also enter the keyword "memory" to invoke the _debug_memory()
method and print out the contents of the Eliza instance's memory.

=cut

sub command_interface {
    my $self = shift;
    my ( $user_input, $previous_user_input, $reply );

    $user_input = "";

    $self->botprompt( $self->name . ":\t" );    # Eliza's prompt
    $self->userprompt("you:\t");                # User's prompt

    # Seed the random number generator.
    srand( time() ^ ( $$ + ( $$ << 15 ) ) );

    # Print the Eliza prompt
    print $self->botprompt if $self->prompts_on;

    # Print an initial greeting
    print
      "$self->{initial}->[ int &{$self->{myrand}}( scalar @{ $self->{initial} } ) ]\n";

        # then dump out the debugging of the
        # most recent call to transform.

        # This variable should have been set by the transform method.

        # Print the actual reply
        print $self->botprompt if $self->prompts_on;

####################################################################
# --- preprocess ---

=head2 preprocess()

    $string = preprocess($string);

preprocess() applies simple substitution rules to the input string.
Mostly this is to catch varieties in spelling, misspellings,
contractions and the like.  

preprocess() is called from within the transform() method.  
It is applied to user-input text, BEFORE any processing,
and before a reassebly statement has been selected. 

It uses the array C<%pre>, which is created 
during the parse of the script.

=cut

sub preprocess {
    my ( $self, $string ) = @_;

    my ( $i, @wordsout, @wordsin, $keyword );

    @wordsout = @wordsin = split / /, $string;

    WORD: for ( $i = 0; $i < @wordsin; $i++ ) {
        foreach $keyword ( keys %{ $self->{pre} } ) {
            if ( $wordsin[$i] =~ /\b$keyword\b/i ) {
                ( $wordsout[$i] = $wordsin[$i] ) =~
                  s/$keyword/$self->{pre}->{$keyword}/ig;
                next WORD;
            }
        }
    }
    return join ' ', @wordsout;
}

####################################################################
# --- postprocess ---

=head2 postprocess()

    $string = postprocess($string);

postprocess() applies simple substitution rules to the 
reassembly rule.  This is where all the "I"'s and "you"'s 
are exchanged.  postprocess() is called from within the
transform() function.

It uses the array C<%post>, created 
during the parse of the script.

=cut

sub postprocess {
    my ( $self, $string ) = @_;

    my ( $i, @wordsout, @wordsin, $keyword );

    @wordsin = @wordsout = split( / /, $string );

    WORD: for ( $i = 0; $i < @wordsin; $i++ ) {
        foreach $keyword ( keys %{ $self->{post} } ) {
            if ( $wordsin[$i] =~ /\b$keyword\b/i ) {
                ( $wordsout[$i] = $wordsin[$i] ) =~
                  s/$keyword/$self->{post}->{$keyword}/ig;
                next WORD;
            }
        }
    }
    return join ' ', @wordsout;
}

####################################################################
# --- _testquit ---

=head2 _testquit()

     if ($self->_testquit($user_input) ) { ... }

_testquit() detects words like "bye" and "quit" and returns
true if it finds one of them as the first word in the sentence. 

These words are listed in the script, under the keyword "quit". 

=cut

sub _testquit {
    my ( $self, $string ) = @_;

    my ( $quitword, @wordsin );

    foreach $quitword ( @{ $self->{quit} } ) {
        return 1 if ( $string =~ /\b$quitword\b/i );
    }
}

####################################################################
# --- _debug_memory ---

=head2 _debug_memory()

     $self->_debug_memory()

_debug_memory() is a special function which returns
the contents of Eliza's memory stack. 


=cut

sub _debug_memory {

    my ($self) = @_;

    my $string = "\t";
    $string .= $#{ $self->memory } + 1;
    $string .= " item(s) in memory stack:\n";

    # [Thanks to Roy Stephan for helping me adjust this bit]
    #
    foreach ( @{ $self->memory } ) {

        my $line = $_;
        $string .= sprintf "\t\t->$line\n";
    }

    return $string;
}

####################################################################
# --- transform ---

=head2 transform()

    $reply = $chatterbot->transform( $string, $use_memory );

transform() applies transformation rules to the user input
string.  It invokes preprocess(), does transformations, 
then invokes postprocess().  It returns the tranformed 
output string, called C<$reasmb>.  

The algorithm embedded in the transform() method has three main parts:

=over

=item 1 

Search the input string for a keyword.

=item 2 

If we find a keyword, use the list of decomposition rules
for that keyword, and pattern-match the input string against
each rule.

=item 3

If the input string matches any of the decomposition rules,
then randomly select one of the reassembly rules for that
decomposition rule, and use it to construct the reply. 

=back

transform() takes two parameters.  The first is the string we want
to transform.  The second is a flag which indicates where this sting
came from.  If the flag is set, then the string has been pulled
from memory, and we should use reassembly rules appropriate
for that.  If the flag is not set, then the string is the most
recent user input, and we can use the ordinary reassembly rules. 

The memory flag is only set when the transform() function is called 
recursively.  The mechanism for setting this parameter is
embedded in the transoform method itself.  If the flag is set
inappropriately, it is ignored.  

=cut

sub transform {
    my ( $self, $string, $use_memory ) = @_;

    # Initialize the debugging text buffer.

=head2 How memory is used

An Eliza object remembers up to C<$max_memory_size> (default: 5) 
user input strings.  Eliza remembers any comment when it matches
a docomposition rule for which there are any reassembly rules for 
memory. In the script, such reassembly rules are marked with
the keyword "reasm_for_memory".  

If the transform() method fails to find any appropriate decomposition
rule for a user's comment, and if there are any comments inside 
the memory array, then Eliza may elect to ignore the most recent comment 
and instead pull out one of the strings from memory.  In this case, 
the transform method is called recursively with the memory flag. 

Honestly, I am not sure exactly how this memory functionality
was implemented in the original Eliza program.  Hopefully
this implementation is not too far from Weizenbaum's. 

If you don't want to use the memory functionality at all,
then you can disable it:

	$mybot->memory_on(0);

You can also achieve the same effect by making sure
that the script data does not contain any reassembly rules 
marked with the keyword "reasm_for_memory".  The default
script data only has 4 such items.

# --- parse_script_data ---

=head2 parse_script_data()

    $self->parse_script_data;
    $self->parse_script_data( $script_file );

parse_script_data() is invoked from the _initialize() method,
which is called from the new() function.  However, you can also
call this method at any time against an already-instantiated 
Eliza instance.  In that case, the new script data is I<added>
to the old script data.  The old script data is not deleted. 

You can pass a parameter to this function, which is the name of the
script file, and it will read in and parse that file.  
If you do not pass any parameter to this method, then
it will read the data embedded at the end of the module as its
default script data.  

If you pass the name of a script file to parse_script_data(), 
and that file is not available for reading, then the module dies.  


=head1 Format of the script file

This module includes a default script file within itself, 
so it is not necessary to explicitly specify a script file 
when instantiating an Eliza object.  

Each line in the script file can specify a key,
a decomposition rule, or a reassembly rule.

  key: remember 5
    decomp: * i remember *
      reasmb: Do you often think of (2) ?
      reasmb: Does thinking of (2) bring anything else to mind ?
    decomp: * do you remember *
      reasmb: Did you think I would forget (2) ?
      reasmb: What about (2) ?
      reasmb: goto what
  pre: equivalent alike
  synon: belief feel think believe wish

The number after the key specifies the rank.
If a user's input contains the keyword, then
the transform() function will try to match
one of the decomposition rules for that keyword.
If one matches, then it will select one of
the reassembly rules at random.  The number
(2) here means "use whatever set of words
matched the second asterisk in the decomposition
rule." 

If you specify a list of synonyms for a word,
the you should use a "@" when you use that
word in a decomposition rule:

  decomp: * i @belief i *
    reasmb: Do you really think so ?
    reasmb: But you are not sure you (3).

Otherwise, the script will never check to see
if there are any synonyms for that keyword. 

Reassembly rules should be marked with I<reasm_for_memory>
rather than I<reasmb> when it is appropriate for use
when a user's comment has been extracted from memory. 

  key: my 2
    decomp: * my *
      reasm_for_memory: Let's discuss further why your (2).
      reasm_for_memory: Earlier you said your (2).
      reasm_for_memory: But your (2).
      reasm_for_memory: Does that have anything to do with the fact that your (2) ?

=head1 How the script file is parsed

Each line in the script file contains an "entrytype"
(key, decomp, synon) and an "entry", separated by
a colon.  In turn, each "entry" can itself be 
composed of a "key" and a "value", separated by
a space.  The parse_script_data() function
parses each line out, and splits the "entry" and
"entrytype" portion of each line into two variables,
C<$entry> and C<$entrytype>. 

Next, it uses the string C<$entrytype> to determine 
what sort of stuff to expect in the C<$entry> variable,  
if anything, and parses it accordingly.  In some cases,
there is no second level of key-value pair, so the function
does not even bother to isolate or create C<$key> and C<$value>. 

C<$key> is always a single word.  C<$value> can be null, 
or one single word, or a string composed of several words, 
or an array of words.  

Based on all these entries and keys and values,
the function creates two giant hashes:
C<%decomplist>, which holds the decomposition rules for
each keyword, and C<%reasmblist>, which holds the 
reassembly phrases for each decomposition rule. 
It also creates C<%keyranks>, which holds the ranks for
each key.  

Six other arrays are created: C<%reasm_for_memory, %pre, %post, 
%synon, @initial,> and C<@final>.
