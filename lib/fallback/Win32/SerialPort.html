<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
This module uses Win32API::CommPort for raw access to the API calls and
related constants. It provides an object-based user interface to allow
higher-level use of common API call sequences for dealing with serial
ports.


<P>

Uses features of the Win32 API to implement non-blocking I/O, serial
parameter setting, event-loop operation, and enhanced error handling.


<P>

To pass in <CODE>NULL</CODE> as the pointer to an optional buffer, pass in <CODE>$null=0</CODE>. This is expected to change to an empty list reference, <CODE>[]</CODE>, when Perl supports that form in this usage.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Initialization">Initialization

</A></H2>
The primary constructor is <STRONG>new</STRONG> with a <EM>PortName</EM> (as the Registry knows it) specified. This will create an object, and get
the available options and capabilities via the Win32 API. The object is a
superset of a <STRONG>Win32API::CommPort</STRONG> object, and supports all of its methods. The port is not yet ready for
read/write access. First, the desired
<EM>parameter settings</EM> must be established. Since these are tuning constants for an underlying
hardware driver in the Operating System, they are all checked for validity
by the methods that set them. The
<STRONG>write_settings</STRONG> method writes a new <EM>Device Control Block</EM> to the driver. The <STRONG>write_settings</STRONG> method will return true if the port is ready for access or <CODE>undef</CODE> on failure. Ports are opened for binary transfers. A separate <CODE>binmode</CODE> is not needed. The USER must release the object if <STRONG>write_settings</STRONG> does not succeed.


<P>

Version 0.15 adds an optional <CODE>$quiet</CODE> parameter to <STRONG>new</STRONG>. Failure to open a port prints a error message to STDOUT by default. Since
only one application at a time can ``own'' the port, one source of failure
was ``port in use''. There was previously no way to check this without
getting a ``fail message''. Setting <CODE>$quiet</CODE> disables this built-in message. It also returns 0 instead of <CODE>undef</CODE> if the port is unavailable (still FALSE, used for testing this condition -
other faults may still return <CODE>undef</CODE>). Use of <CODE>$quiet</CODE> only applies to <STRONG>new</STRONG>.


<P>

Certain parameters <EM>MUST</EM> be set before executing <STRONG>write_settings</STRONG>. Others will attempt to deduce defaults from the hardware or from other
parameters. The <EM>Required</EM> parameters are:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_baudrate">baudrate

</A></STRONG><DD>
Any legal value.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_parity">parity

</A></STRONG><DD>
One of the following: ``none'', ``odd'', ``even'', ``mark'', ``space''. If
you select anything except ``none'', you will need to set <STRONG>parity_enable</STRONG>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_databits">databits

</A></STRONG><DD>
An integer from 5 to 8.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_stopbits">stopbits

</A></STRONG><DD>
Legal values are 1, 1.5, and 2. But 1.5 only works with 5 databits, 2 does
not work with 5 databits, and other combinations may not work on all
hardware if parity is also used.


<P>

</DL>
The <STRONG>handshake</STRONG> setting is recommended but no longer required. Select one of the following:
``none'', ``rts'', ``xoff'', ``dtr''.


<P>

Some individual parameters (eg. baudrate) can be changed after the
initialization is completed. These will be validated and will update the <EM>Device Control Block</EM> as required. The <STRONG>save</STRONG>
method will write the current parameters to a file that <STRONG>start, tie,</STRONG> and
<STRONG>restart</STRONG> can use to reestablish a functional setup.


<P>

<PRE>  $PortObj = new Win32::SerialPort ($PortName, $quiet)
       || die &quot;Can't open $PortName: $^E\n&quot;;    # $quiet is optional

  $PortObj-&gt;stopbits(1);
  $PortObj-&gt;handshake(&quot;rts&quot;);

</PRE>

<P>

The <EM>PortName</EM> maps to both the Registry <EM>Device Name</EM> and the
<EM>Properties</EM> associated with that device. A single <EM>Physical</EM> port can be accessed using two or more <EM>Device Names</EM>. But the options and setup data will differ significantly in the two
cases. A typical example is a Modem on port ``COM2''. Both of these <EM>PortNames</EM> open the same <EM>Physical</EM> hardware:


<P>

<PRE>  $P1 = new Win32::SerialPort (&quot;COM2&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  $P2 = new Win32::SerialPort (&quot;\\\\.\\Nanohertz Modem model K-9&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

<CODE>$P1</CODE> is a ``generic'' serial port. <CODE>$P2</CODE> includes
all of <CODE>$P1</CODE> plus a variety of modem-specific added options and
features. The ``raw'' API calls return different size configuration
structures in the two cases. Win32 uses the ``\\.\'' prefix to identify
``named'' devices. Since both names use the same
<EM>Physical</EM> hardware, they can not both be used at the same time. The OS will complain.
Consider this A Good Thing. Use <STRONG>alias</STRONG> to convert the name used by ``built-in'' messages.


<P>

<PRE>  $P2-&gt;alias(&quot;FIDO&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

The second constructor, <STRONG>start</STRONG> is intended to simplify scripts which need a constant setup. It executes
all the steps from <STRONG>new</STRONG> to
<STRONG>write_settings</STRONG> based on a previously saved configuration. This constructor will return <CODE>undef</CODE> on a bad configuration file or failure of a validity check. The returned
object is ready for access.


<P>

<PRE>  $PortObj2 = start Win32::SerialPort ($Configuration_File_Name)
       || die;
</PRE>

<P>

The third constructor, <STRONG>tie</STRONG>, combines the <STRONG>start</STRONG> with Perl's support for tied FileHandles (see <EM>perltie</EM>). Win32::SerialPort implements the complete set of methods: TIEHANDLE,
PRINT, PRINTF, WRITE, READ, GETC, READLINE, CLOSE, and DESTROY. Tied
FileHandle support was new with Version 0.14.


<P>

<PRE>  $PortObj2 = tie (*FH, 'Win32::SerialPort', $Configuration_File_Name)
       || die;
</PRE>

<P>

The implementation attempts to mimic STDIN/STDOUT behaviour as closely as
possible: calls block until done, data strings that exceed internal buffers
are divided transparently into multiple calls, and <STRONG>stty_onlcr</STRONG>
and <STRONG>stty_ocrnl</STRONG> are applied to output data (WRITE, PRINT, PRINTF) when
<STRONG>stty_opost</STRONG> is true. In Version 0.17, the output separators <CODE>$,</CODE> and
<CODE>$\</CODE> are also applied to PRINT if set. Since PRINTF is treated internally as a
single record PRINT, <CODE>$\</CODE> will be applied. Output separators are not applied to WRITE (called as <CODE>syswrite FH, $scalar, $length, [$offset]</CODE>).


<P>

The <STRONG>output_record_separator</STRONG> and <STRONG>output_field_separator</STRONG> methods can set
<EM>Port-FileHandle-Specific</EM> versions of <CODE>$,</CODE> and <CODE>$\</CODE> if desired. The input_record_separator <CODE>$/</CODE> is not explicitly supported - but an identical function can be obtained
with a suitable <STRONG>are_match</STRONG> setting. Record separators are experimental in Version 0.17. They are not
saved in the configuration_file.


<P>

The tied FileHandle methods may be combined with the Win32::SerialPort
methods for <STRONG>read, input</STRONG>, and <STRONG>write</STRONG> as well as other methods. The typical restrictions against mixing <STRONG>print</STRONG> with <STRONG>syswrite</STRONG> do not apply. Since both <STRONG>(tied) read</STRONG> and <STRONG>sysread</STRONG> call the same <CODE>$ob-&gt;READ</CODE>
method, and since a separate <CODE>$ob-&gt;read</CODE> method has existed for some time in Win32::SerialPort, you should always
use <STRONG>sysread</STRONG> with the tied interface. Beginning in Version 0.17, <STRONG>sysread</STRONG> checks the input against <STRONG>stty_icrnl</STRONG>, <STRONG>stty_inlcr</STRONG>, and <STRONG>stty_igncr</STRONG>. With <STRONG>stty_igncr</STRONG>
active, the <STRONG>sysread</STRONG> returns the count of all characters received including and <CODE>\r</CODE> characters subsequently deleted.


<P>

Because all the tied methods block, they should ALWAYS be used with timeout
settings and are not suitable for background operations and polled loops.
The <STRONG>sysread</STRONG> method may return fewer characters than requested when a timeout occurs.
The method call is still considered successful. If a <STRONG>sysread</STRONG> times out after receiving some characters, the actual elapsed time may be
as much as twice the programmed limit. If no bytes are received, the normal
timing applies.

Starting in Version 0.18, a number of <EM>Application Variables</EM> are saved in <STRONG>$Configuration_File</STRONG>. These parameters are not used internally. But methods allow setting and
reading them. The intent is to facilitate the use of separate <EM>configuration scripts</EM> to create the files. Then an application can use <STRONG>start</STRONG> as the Constructor and not bother with command line processing or managing
its own small configuration file. The default values and number of

The Win32 Serial Comm API provides extensive information concerning the
capabilities and options available for a specific port (and instance).
``Modem'' ports have different capabilties than ``RS-232'' ports - even if
they share the same Hardware. Many traditional modem actions are handled
via TAPI. ``Fax'' ports have another set of options - and are accessed via
MAPI. Yet many of the same low-level API commands and data structures are
``common'' to each type (``Modem'' is implemented as an ``RS-232''
superset). In addition, Win95 supports a variety of legacy hardware (e.g
fixed 134.5 baud) while WinNT has hooks for ISDN, 16-data-bit paths, and
256Kbaud.


<P>

Binary selections will accept as <EM>true</EM> any of the following:
<CODE>("YES", "Y", "ON", "TRUE", "T", "1", 1)</CODE> (upper/lower/mixed case) Anything else is <EM>false</EM>.


<P>

There are a large number of possible configuration and option parameters.
To facilitate checking option validity in scripts, most configuration
methods can be used in three different ways:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_method">method called with an argument

</A></STRONG><DD>
The parameter is set to the argument, if valid. An invalid argument returns <EM>false</EM> (undef) and the parameter is unchanged. The function will also <EM>carp</EM> if <STRONG>$user_msg</STRONG> is <EM>true</EM>. After <STRONG>write_settings</STRONG>, the port will be updated immediately if allowed. Otherwise, the value
will be applied when <STRONG>write_settings</STRONG> is called.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>method called with no argument in scalar context

</A></STRONG><DD>
The current value is returned. If the value is not initialized either
directly or by default, return ``undef'' which will parse to <EM>false</EM>. For binary selections (true/false), return the current value. All current
values from ``multivalue'' selections will parse to <EM>true</EM>. Current values may differ from requested values until <STRONG>write_settings</STRONG>. There is no way to see requests which have not yet been applied. Setting
the same parameter again overwrites the first request. Test the return
value of the setting method to check ``success''.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>method called with no argument in list context

</A></STRONG><DD>
Return a list consisting of all acceptable choices for parameters with
discrete choices. Return a list <CODE>(minimum, maximum)</CODE> for parameters which can be set to a range of values. Binary selections
have no need to call this way - but will get <CODE>(0,1)</CODE> if they do. Beginning in Version 0.16, Binary selections inherited from
Win32API::CommPort may not return anything useful in list context. The null
list <CODE>(undef)</CODE>
will be returned for failed calls in list context (e.g. for an invalid or
unexpected argument). 


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Asynchronous">Asynchronous (Background) I/O

</A></STRONG><DD>
The module handles Polling (do if Ready), Synchronous (block until Ready),
and Asynchronous Modes (begin and test if Ready) with the timeout choices
provided by the API. No effort has yet been made to interact with Windows
events. But background I/O has been used successfully with the Perl Tk
modules and callbacks from the event loop.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Timeouts">Timeouts

</A></STRONG><DD>
The API provides two timing models. The first applies only to reading and
essentially determines <EM>Read Not Ready</EM> by checking the time between consecutive characters. The <STRONG>ReadFile</STRONG> operation returns if that time exceeds the value set by <STRONG>read_interval</STRONG>. It does this by timestamping each character. It appears that at least one
character must by received in
<EM>every</EM>  <STRONG>read</STRONG>  <EM>call to the API</EM> to initialize the mechanism. The timer is then reset by each succeeding
character. If no characters are received, the read will block indefinitely. 


<P>

Setting <STRONG>read_interval</STRONG> to <CODE>0xffffffff</CODE> will do a non-blocking read. The <STRONG>ReadFile</STRONG> returns immediately whether or not any characters are actually read. This
replicates the behavior of the API.


<P>

The other model defines the total time allowed to complete the operation. A
fixed overhead time is added to the product of bytes and per_byte_time. A
wide variety of timeout options can be defined by selecting the three
parameters: fixed, each, and size.


<P>

Read_Total = <STRONG>read_const_time</STRONG> + (<STRONG>read_char_time</STRONG> * bytes_to_read)


<P>

Write_Total = <STRONG>write_const_time</STRONG> + (<STRONG>write_char_time</STRONG> * bytes_to_write)


<P>

When reading a known number of characters, the <EM>Read_Total</EM> mechanism is recommended. This mechanism <EM>MUST</EM> be used with <EM>tied FileHandles</EM> because the tie methods can make multiple internal API calls in response to
a single
<STRONG>sysread</STRONG> or <STRONG>READLINE</STRONG>. The <EM>Read_Interval</EM> mechanism is suitable for a <STRONG>read</STRONG> method that expects a response of variable or unknown size. You should then
also set a long <EM>Read_Total</EM> timeout as a ``backup'' in case no bytes are received.

Nothing wrong with dreaming! A subset of stty options is available through
a <STRONG>stty</STRONG> method. The purpose is support of existing serial devices which have
embedded knowledge of Unix communication line and login practices. It is
also needed by Tom Christiansen's Perl Power Tools project. This is new and
experimental in Version 0.15. The <STRONG>stty</STRONG> method returns an array of ``traditional stty values'' when called with no
arguments. With arguments, it sets the corresponding parameters.


<P>

<PRE>  $ok = $PortObj-&gt;stty(&quot;-icanon&quot;);      # equivalent to stty_icanon(0)
  @stty_all = $PortObj-&gt;stty();         # get all the parameters, Perl-style
  $ok = $PortObj-&gt;stty(&quot;cs7&quot;,19200);    # multiple parameters
  $ok = $PortObj-&gt;stty(@stty_save);     # many parameters
</PRE>

<P>

The distribution includes a demo script, stty.plx, which gives details of
usage. Not all Unix parameters are currently supported. But the array will
contain all those which can be set. The order in <CODE>@stty_all</CODE> will match the following pattern:


<P>

<PRE>  baud,                 # numeric, always first
  &quot;intr&quot;, character,    # the parameters which set special characters
  &quot;name&quot;, character, ...
  &quot;stop&quot;, character,    # &quot;stop&quot; will always be the last &quot;pair&quot;
  &quot;parameter&quot;,          # the on/off settings
  &quot;-parameter&quot;, ...
</PRE>

<P>

Version 0.13 added the primitive functions required to implement this
feature. A number of methods named <STRONG>stty_xxx</STRONG> do what an
<EM>experienced stty user</EM> would expect. Unlike <STRONG>stty</STRONG> on Unix, the <STRONG>stty_xxx</STRONG> operations apply only to I/O processed via the <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> method or the <EM>tied FileHandle</EM> methods.

Many of the <STRONG>stty_xxx</STRONG> methods support features which are necessary for line-oriented input (such
as command-line handling). These include methods which select control-keys
to delete characters (<STRONG>stty_erase</STRONG>) and lines (<STRONG>stty_kill</STRONG>), define input boundaries (<STRONG>stty_eol, stty_eof</STRONG>), and abort processing (<STRONG>stty_intr, stty_quit</STRONG>). These keys also have <STRONG>is_stty_xxx</STRONG>
methods which convert the key-codes to numeric equivalents which can be
saved in the configuration file.


<P>

Some communications programs have a different but related need - to collect
(or discard) input until a specific pattern is detected. For lines, the
pattern is a line-termination. But there are also requirements to search
for other strings in the input such as ``username:'' and ``password:''. The
<STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> method provides a consistant mechanism for solving this problem. It
searches input character-by-character looking for a match to any of the
elements of an array set using the <STRONG>are_match</STRONG> method. It returns the entire input up to the match pattern if a match is
found. If no match is found, it returns ``'' unless an input error or abort
is detected (which returns undef).


<P>

The actual match and the characters after it (if any) may also be viewed
using the <STRONG>lastlook</STRONG> method. In Version 0.13, the match test included a <CODE>s/$pattern//s</CODE> test which worked fine for literal text but returned the <EM>Regular Expression</EM> that matched when <CODE>$pattern</CODE> contained any Perl metacharacters. That was probably a bug - although no
one reported it.


<P>

In Version 0.14, <STRONG>lastlook</STRONG> returns both the input and the pattern from the match test. It also adopts
the convention from Expect.pm that match strings are literal text (tested
using <STRONG>index</STRONG>) unless preceeded in the
<STRONG>are_match</STRONG> list by a <STRONG>"-re",</STRONG> entry. The default <STRONG>are_match</STRONG> list is <CODE>("\n")</CODE>, which matches complete lines.


<P>

<PRE>   my ($match, $after, $pattern, $instead) = $PortObj-&gt;lastlook;
     # input that MATCHED, input AFTER the match, PATTERN that matched
     # input received INSTEAD when timeout without match (&quot;&quot; if match)
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>   $PortObj-&gt;are_match(&quot;text1&quot;, &quot;-re&quot;, &quot;pattern&quot;, &quot;text2&quot;);
     # possible match strings: &quot;pattern&quot; is a regular expression,
     #                         &quot;text1&quot; and &quot;text2&quot; are literal strings
</PRE>

<P>

The <EM>Regular Expression</EM> handling in <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> is still experimental. Please let me know if you use it (or can't use it),
so I can confirm bug fixes don't break your code. For literal strings,
<CODE>$match</CODE> and <CODE>$pattern</CODE> should be identical. The <CODE>$instead</CODE> value returns the internal buffer tested by the match logic. A successful
match or a <STRONG>lookclear</STRONG> resets it to ``'' - so it is only useful for error handling such as timeout
processing or reporting unexpected responses.


<P>

The <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> method is designed to be sampled periodically (polled). Any characters
after the match pattern are saved for a subsequent <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG>. Internally, <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> is implemented using the nonblocking <STRONG>input</STRONG> method when called with no parameter. If called with a count, <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> calls
<CODE>$PortObj-&gt;read(count)</CODE> which blocks until the <STRONG>read</STRONG> is <EM>Complete</EM> or a <EM>Timeout</EM> occurs. The blocking alternative should not be used unless a fault time has
been defined using <STRONG>read_interval, read_const_time, and
read_char_time</STRONG>. It exists mostly to support the <EM>tied FileHandle</EM>
functions <STRONG>sysread, getc,</STRONG> and <STRONG>&lt;FH&gt;</STRONG>.


<P>

The internal buffers used by <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> may be purged by the <STRONG>lookclear</STRONG>
method (which also clears the last match). For testing, <STRONG>lookclear</STRONG> can accept a string which is ``looped back'' to the next <STRONG>input</STRONG>. This feature is enabled only when <CODE>set_test_mode_active(1)</CODE>. Normally, <STRONG>lookclear</STRONG>
will return <CODE>undef</CODE> if given parameters. It still purges the buffers and last_match in that
case (but nothing is ``looped back''). You will want
<STRONG>stty_echo(0)</STRONG> when exercising loopback.


<P>

Version 0.15 adds a <STRONG>matchclear</STRONG> method. It is designed to handle the ``special case'' where the match
string is the first <CODE>character(s)</CODE> received by <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG>. In this case, <CODE>$lookfor_return == ""</CODE>, <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> does not provide a clear indication that a match was found. The <STRONG>matchclear</STRONG>
returns the same <CODE>$match</CODE> that would be returned by <STRONG>lastlook</STRONG> and resets it to ``'' without resetting any of the other buffers. Since the
<STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> already searched <EM>through</EM> the match, <STRONG>matchclear</STRONG> is used to both detect and step-over ``blank'' lines.


<P>

The character-by-character processing used by <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> to support the
<EM>stty emulation</EM> is fine for interactive activities and tasks which expect short responses.
But it has too much ``overhead'' to handle fast data streams. Version 0.15
adds a <STRONG>streamline</STRONG> method which is a fast, line-oriented alternative with no echo support or
input handling except for pattern searching. Exact benchmarks will vary
with input data and patterns, but my tests indicate <STRONG>streamline</STRONG> is 10-20 times faster then
<STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> when uploading files averaging 25-50 characters per line. Since <STRONG>streamline</STRONG> uses the same internal buffers, the <STRONG>lookclear,
lastlook, are_match, and matchclear</STRONG> methods act the same in both cases. In fact, calls to <STRONG>streamline</STRONG> and <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> can be interleaved if desired (e.g. an interactive task that starts an
upload and returns to interactive activity when it is complete).


<P>

Beginning in Version 0.15, the <STRONG>READLINE</STRONG> method supports ``list context''. A tied FileHandle can slurp in a whole
file with an ``@lines = &lt;FH&gt;`` construct. In ''scalar context``, <STRONG>READLINE</STRONG> calls <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG>. But it calls
<STRONG>streamline</STRONG> in ``list context''. Both contexts also call <STRONG>matchclear</STRONG>
to detect ``empty'' lines and <STRONG>reset_error</STRONG> to detect hardware problems. The existance of a hardware fault is reported
with <CODE>$^E</CODE>, although the specific fault is only reported when <STRONG>error_msg</STRONG> is true.


<P>

There are two additional methods for supporting ``list context'' input:
<STRONG>lastline</STRONG> sets an ``end_of_file'' <EM>Regular Expression</EM>, and <STRONG>linesize</STRONG>
permits changing the ``packet size'' in the blocking read operation to
allow tuning performance to data characteristics. These two only apply
during
<STRONG>READLINE</STRONG>. The default for <STRONG>linesize</STRONG> is 1. There is no default for the <STRONG>lastline</STRONG> method.


<P>

In Version 0.15, <EM>Regular Expressions</EM> set by <STRONG>are_match</STRONG> and <STRONG>lastline</STRONG>
will be pre-compiled using the <EM>qr//</EM> construct on Perl 5.005 and higher. This doubled <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> and <STRONG>streamline</STRONG> speed in my tests with
<EM>Regular Expressions</EM> - but actual improvements depend on both patterns and input data.


<P>

The functionality of <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> includes a limited subset of the capabilities found in Austin Schutz's <EM>Expect.pm</EM> for Unix (and Tcl's expect which it resembles). The <CODE>$before, $match, $pattern, and $after</CODE> return values are available if someone needs to create an ``expect''
subroutine for porting a script. When using multiple patterns, there is one
important functional difference: <EM>Expect.pm</EM> looks at each pattern in turn and returns the first match found; <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> and <STRONG>streamline</STRONG> test all patterns and return the one found <EM>earliest</EM> in the input if more than one matches.


<P>

Because <STRONG>lookfor</STRONG> can be used to manage a command-line environment much like a Unix serial
login, a number of ``stty-like'' methods are included to handle the issues
raised by serial logins. One issue is dissimilar line terminations. This is
addressed by the following methods:


<P>

<PRE>  $PortObj-&gt;stty_icrnl;         # map \r to \n on input
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_igncr;         # ignore \r on input
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_inlcr;         # map \n to \r on input
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_ocrnl;         # map \r to \n on output
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_onlcr;         # map \n to \r\n on output
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_opost;         # enable output mapping
</PRE>

<P>

The default specifies a raw device with no input or output processing. In
Version 0.14, the default was a device which sends ``\r'' at the end of a
line, requires ``\r\n'' to terminate incoming lines, and expects the
``host'' to echo every keystroke. Many ``dumb terminals'' act this way and
the defaults were similar to Unix defaults. But some users found this
ackward and confusing.


<P>

Sometimes, you want perl to echo input characters back to the serial device
(and other times you don't want that).  


<P>

<PRE>  $PortObj-&gt;stty_echo;          # echo every character
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_echoe;         # if echo erase with bsdel string (default)
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_echok;         # if echo \n after kill character (default)
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_echonl;        # echo \n even if stty_echo(0)
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_echoke;        # if echo clear string after kill (default)
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_echoctl;       # if echo &quot;^Char&quot; for control chars
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  $PortObj-&gt;stty_istrip;        # strip input to 7-bits
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  my $air = &quot; &quot;x76;             # overwrite entire line with spaces
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_clear(&quot;\r$air\r&quot;);     # written after kill character
  $PortObj-&gt;is_prompt(&quot;PROMPT:&quot;);       # need to write after kill
  $PortObj-&gt;stty_bsdel(&quot;\cH \cH&quot;);      # written after erase character
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>  # internal method that permits clear string with \r in config file
  my $plus32 = &quot;@&quot;x76;          # overwrite line with spaces (ord += 32)
  $PortObj-&gt;is_stty_clear(&quot;-$plus32-&quot;); # equivalent to stty_clear

The object returned by <STRONG>new</STRONG> or <STRONG>start</STRONG> is NOT a <EM>FileHandle</EM>. You will be disappointed if you try to use it as one. If you need a
<EM>FileHandle</EM>, you must use <STRONG>tie</STRONG> as the constructor.


<P>

e.g. the following is WRONG!!____<CODE>print $PortObj "some text";</CODE>




<P>

You need something like this (Perl 5.005):


<P>

<PRE>        # construct
    $tie_ob = tie(*FOO,'Win32::SerialPort', $cfgfile)
                 or die &quot;Can't start $cfgfile\n&quot;;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    print FOO &quot;enter char: &quot;; # destination is FileHandle, not Object
    my $in = getc FOO;
    syswrite FOO, &quot;$in\n&quot;, 2, 0;
    print FOO &quot;enter line: &quot;;
    $in = &lt;FOO&gt;;
    printf FOO &quot;received: %s\n&quot;, $in;
    print FOO &quot;enter 5 char: &quot;;
    sysread (FOO, $in, 5, 0) or die;
    printf FOO &quot;received: %s\n&quot;, $in;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        # destruct
    close FOO || print &quot;close failed\n&quot;;
    undef $tie_ob;      # Don't forget this one!!
    untie *FOO;
</PRE>

<P>

Always include the <CODE>undef $tie_ob</CODE> before the <STRONG>untie</STRONG>. See the <EM>Gotcha</EM>
description in <EM>perltie</EM>.


<P>

The Perl 5.004 implementation of <EM>tied FileHandles</EM> is missing
<STRONG>close</STRONG> and <STRONG>syswrite</STRONG>. The Perl 5.003 version is essentially unusable. If you need these
functions, consider Perl 5.005 seriously.


<P>

An important note about Win32 filenames. The reserved device names such as <CODE><PRE> COM1, AUX, LPT1, CON, PRN 
</PRE>
</CODE> can NOT be used as filenames. Hence
<EM>"COM2.cfg"</EM> would not be usable for <STRONG>$Configuration_File_Name</STRONG>.


<P>

Thanks to Ken White for testing on NT.


<P>

There is a linux clone of this module implemented using <EM>POSIX.pm</EM>. It also runs on AIX and Solaris, and will probably run on other POSIX
systems as well. It does not currently support the complete set of methods
- although portability of user programs is excellent for the calls it does
support. It is available from CPAN as <EM>Device::SerialPort</EM>.

<H1><A NAME="KNOWN_LIMITATIONS">KNOWN LIMITATIONS

</A></H1>
Since everything is (sometimes convoluted but still pure) Perl, you can fix
flaws and change limits if required. But please file a bug report if you
do. This module has been tested with each of the binary perl versions for
which Win32::API is supported: AS builds 315, 316, 500-509 and GS 5.004_02.
It has only been tested on Intel hardware.


<P>

Although the <STRONG>lookfor, stty_xxx, and Tied FileHandle</STRONG> mechanisms are considered stable, they have only been tested on a small
subset of possible applications. While ``\r'' characters may be included in
the clear string using <STRONG>is_stty_clear</STRONG> internally, ``\n'' characters may NOT be included in multi-character
strings if you plan to save the strings in a configuration file (which uses
``\n'' as an internal terminator).

With all the options, this module needs a good tutorial. It doesn't have a
complete one yet. A <EM>"How to get started"</EM> tutorial appeared
<STRONG>The Perl Journal #13</STRONG> (March 1999). Examples from the article are available from <A
HREF="http://tpj.com">http://tpj.com</A> and from <A

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Buffers">Buffers

</A></STRONG><DD>
The size of the Win32 buffers are selectable with <STRONG>buffers</STRONG>. But each read method currently uses a fixed internal buffer of 4096
bytes. This can be changed in the Win32API::CommPort source and read with <STRONG>internal_buffer</STRONG>. The XS version will support dynamic buffer sizing. Large operations are
automatically converted to multiple smaller ones by the <STRONG>tied FileHandle</STRONG>
methods.

Lots of modem-specific options are not supported. The same is true of TAPI,
MAPI. <EM>API Wizards</EM> are welcome to contribute.

</A></STRONG><DD>
Lots of options are just ``passed through from the API''. Some probably

possible. For something really fancy, you may need additional API
documentation. Available from <EM>Micro$oft Pre$$</EM>.

On Win32, a port must <STRONG>close</STRONG> before it can be reopened again by the same process. If a physical port can
be accessed using more than one name (see above), all names are treated as
one. The perl script can also be run multiple times within a single batch
file or shell script. The <EM>Makefile.PL</EM>
spawns subshells with backticks to run the test suite on Perl 5.003 - ugly,
but it works.


<P>

On NT, a <STRONG>read_done</STRONG> or <STRONG>write_done</STRONG> returns <EM>False</EM> if a background operation is aborted by a purge. Win95 returns <EM>True</EM>.


<P>

EXTENDED_OS_ERROR ($^E) is not supported by the binary ports before 5.005.
It ``sort-of-tracks'' <STRONG>$!</STRONG> in 5.003 and 5.004, but YMMV.


<P>

A few NT systems seem to set <STRONG>can_parity_enable</STRONG> true, but do not actually support setting <STRONG>parity_enable</STRONG>. This may be a characteristic of certain third-party serial drivers.

</A></H2>
Most of the code in this module has been stable since version 0.12. Except
for items indicated as <EM>Experimental</EM>, I do not expect functional changes which are not fully backwards
compatible. However, Version 0.16 removes the ``dummy (0, 1) list'' which
was returned by many binary methods in case they were called in list
context. I do not know of any use outside the test suite for that feature.


<P>

Version 0.12 added an <EM>Install.PL</EM> script to put modules into the documented Namespaces. The script uses <EM>MakeMaker</EM> tools not available in ActiveState 3xx builds. Users of those builds will
need to install differently (see README). Programs in the test suite are
modified for the current version. Additions to the configurtion files
generated by
<STRONG>save</STRONG> prevent those created by Version 0.18 from being used by earlier Versions.
