Win32::DriveInfo
----------------

With this module you can get total/free space on Win32 drives,
volume names, architecture, filesystem type, drive attributes, list of all
available drives and free drive-letters. Additional function to determine
Windows version info. 

The intention was to have a part of Dave Roth's Win32::AdminMisc
functionality on Win95/98. 

The current version of Win32::DriveInfo is available at: 

  http://www.dux.ru/guest/fno/perl/


DriveSpace ( drive ) 
     ($SectorsPerCluster, $BytesPerSector, $NumberOfFreeClusters,
     $TotalNumberOfClusters, $FreeBytesAvailableToCaller, $TotalNumberOfBytes,
     $TotalNumberOfFreeBytes) = Win32::DriveInfo::DriveSpace( drive ); 

DrivesInUse ( ) 
     Returns all drive-letters in use. 

FreeDriveLetters ( ) 
     Returns all drive-letters that are available for allocation. 

DriveType ( drive ) 
     Detects fixed, removable, networked, CD ROM and RAM drives. 

VolumeInfo ( drive ) 
     ($VolumeName, $VolumeSerialNumber, $MaximumComponentLength,
      $FileSystemName, @attr) = Win32::DriveInfo::VolumeInfo ( drive ); 
GetVersionEx ( ) 
     major/minor/build of the operating system in use.


You need Win32::API.pm by Aldo Calpini for this module. 

No special installation is needed.
Just put it into /Win32 subdir somewhere in your @INC. 


This module has been created and tested in a Win95 environment on GS port
of Perl 5.004_02. Please share your experience/bug-reports on other
platforms.

For more look into POD documentation.
