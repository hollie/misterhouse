=head1 NAME

XML::Handler::Subs - a PerlSAX handler base class for calling user-defined subs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use XML::Handler::Subs;

 package MyHandlers;
 use vars qw{ @ISA };

 sub s_NAME { my ($self, $element) = @_ };
 sub e_NAME { my ($self, $element) = @_ };

 $self->{Names};    # an array of names
 $self->{Nodes};    # an array of $element nodes

 $handler = MyHandlers->new();
 $self->in_element($name);
 $self->within_element($name);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<XML::Handler::Subs> is a base class for PerlSAX handlers.
C<XML::Handler::Subs> is subclassed to implement complete behavior and
to add element-specific handling.

Each time an element starts, a method by that name prefixed with `s_'
is called with the element to be processed.  Each time an element
ends, a method with that name prefixed with `e_' is called.  Any
special characters in the element name are replaced by underscores.

Subclassing XML::Handler::Subs in this way is similar to
XML::Parser's Subs style.

XML::Handler::Subs maintains a stack of element names,
`C<$self->{Names}', and a stack of element nodes, `C<$self->{Nodes}>'
that can be used by subclasses.  The current element is pushed on the
stacks before calling an element-name start method and popped off the
stacks after calling the element-name end method.  The
`C<in_element()>' and `C<within_element()>' calls use these stacks.

If the subclass implements `C<start_document()>', `C<end_document()>',
`C<start_element()>', and `C<end_element()>', be sure to use
`C<SUPER::>' to call the the superclass methods also.  See perlobj(1)
for details on SUPER::.  `C<SUPER::start_element()>' and
`C<SUPER::end_element()>' return 1 if an element-name method is
called, they return 0 if no method was called.

XML::Handler::Subs does not implement any other PerlSAX handlers.

XML::Handler::Subs supports the following methods:

=over 4

=item new( I<OPTIONS> )

A basic `C<new()>' method.  `C<new()>' takes a list of key, value
pairs or a hash and creates and returns a hash with those options; the
hash is blessed into the subclass.

=item in_element($name)

Returns true if `C<$name>' is equal to the name of the innermost
currently opened element.

=item within_element($name)

Returns the number of times the `C<$name>' appears in Names.
