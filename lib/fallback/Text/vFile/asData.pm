=head1 DATA STRUCTURE

A vFile contains one or more objects, delimited by BEGIN and END tags.

  BEGIN:VCARD
  ...
  END:VCARD

Objects may contain sub-objects;

  BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  ...
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  ...
  END:VEVENT
  ...
  ENV:VCALENDAR

Each object consists of one or more properties.  Each property
consists of a name, zero or more optional parameters, and then a
value.  This fragment:

  DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:19970317

identifies a property with the name, C<DSTART>, the parameter
C<VALUE>, which has the value C<DATE>, and the property's value is
C<19970317>.  Those of you with an XML bent might find this more
recognisable as:

  <dtstart value="date">19970317</dtstart>

The return value from the C<parse()> method is a hash ref.

The top level key, C<objects>, refers to an array ref.  Each entry in the
array ref is a hash ref with two or three keys.

The value of the first key, C<type>, is a string corresponding to the
type of the object.  E.g., C<VCARD>, C<VEVENT>, and so on.

The value of the second key, C<properties>, is a hash ref, with property
names as keys, and an array ref of those property values.  It's an array
ref, because some properties may appear within an object multiple times
with different values.  For example;

  BEGIN:VEVENT
  ATTENDEE;CN="Nik Clayton":mailto:nik@FreeBSD.org
  ATTENDEE;CN="Richard Clamp":mailto:richardc@unixbeard.net
  ...
  END:VEVENT

Each entry in the array ref is a hash ref with one or two keys.

The first key, C<value>, corresponds to the property's value.

The second key, C<param>, contains a hash ref of the property's
parameters.  Keys in this hash ref are the parameter's name, the value
is the parameter's value.  (If you enable the C<preserve_params>
option there is an additional key populated, called C<params>.  It is
an array ref of hash refs, each hash ref is the parameter's name and
the parameter's value - these are collected in the order they are
encountered to prevent hash collisions as seen in some vCard files)
line.)

The third key in the top level C<objects> hash ref is C<objects>.  If
it exists, it indicates that sub-objects were found.  The value of
this key is an array ref of sub-objects, with identical keys and
behaviour to that of the top level C<objects> key.  This recursive
structure continues, nesting as deeply as there were sub-objects in
the input file.

The C<bin/v2yaml> script that comes with this distribution displays the
format of a vFile as YAML.  C<t/03usage.t> has examples of picking out
the relevant information from the data structure.

=head1 TODO

=over

=item

More comprehensive tests, especially for the nacsent generate routine.

=item

Write some higher-level modules that use this to create DateTime::*
objects via DateTime::Format::ICal and DateTime::Event::ICal for
vCalendar handling.

=item

Take over the world.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

We don't do any decoding of property values, including descaping
C<\,>, we're still undecided as to whether this is a bug.

=head1 BUGS

Aside from the TODO list items, none known.
