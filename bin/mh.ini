#
#  Notes:
#
#      Rather than edit this file, create your own 'mh.private.ini' file
#      and override just the values you need to.  Then set the mh_parms
#      environment variable to point to this file.  By default it will look
#      for it in mh/bin/mh.private.ini.  You can move this private parm
#      file elsewhere by setting the env. parm mh_parms to point to it:
#
#         On Windows systems, add this to your autoexec.bat
#             set mh_parms=c:\misterhouse\mh.private.ini
#
#         Or set up a batch file with something like this:
#
#            set mh_parms=c:\misterhouse\mh.private.ini
#            c:
#            cd \misterhouse\bin
#            mh
#
#
#         On linux systems, add something this to your /etc/profile:
#             export mh_parms=/prog/misterhouse/mh.private.ini
#
#
#      The idea with mh_parms was to allow you to put your private parms in a
#      directory separate from the main mh distribution, so you could easily point
#      to and upgrade to different mh versions.  Here is what I have:
#
#         /misterhouse/mh.private.ini (has just a the few entries I changed)
#         /misterhouse/bruce  (my code)
#         /misterhouse/data   (my data)
#         /misterhouse/mh     (the mh distro)
#
#      Note that you should use /, not \, on paths, on Windows, just like Unix.
#
#      mh_parms can be a comma delimited list of files
#
#      See the 'Coding your own event' section of mh/docs/install.html for
#      more info
#
#      By changing the following parms, you can keep the mh distribution files
#      separate from your local files (makes upgrades easier):
#        - code_dir
#        - data_dir
#
#      You can also override any of these parameters from the command
#      line.  For example:
#
#          mh -code_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_code
#             -data_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_data
#

# Category = Sound

@ This is the program used to play sound files on unix.  If you don't have a

@ If you have IBM Viavoice TTS engine installed, set this to vv_tts to
@ redirect sound files so they are single threaded with the rest of the sounds.

@ only used by the Google TTS engine.  The default is ffmpeg, but this is unavailable
@ on some platforms, Ubuntu for example, which requires the use of avconv instead.

@ Set this to 1 to use fork, rather than system calls, when calling sound_program

# Category = Web

@ Point to the html file that is used for the web interface.
@
@ - See  mh/docs/mh.*, section 'Customizing the Web Interface' for more
@ documentation
@
@ You can have browser specific html_* parms by using a numeric suffix.
@ For example, see the html_file1, html_cols1, and html_table_size1 parms.
@ Use the html_browser_formats parm to pick which browser gets which format.
@
@ Note: As with many mh parms, if you want to quickly try most of the following
@ you can use the mh reload button/function, then refresh your webpage. You do
@ not have to exit mh.

html_dir  = $Pgm_Root/web

@ - html_alias*  Points to other directories that are not subdirectories of
@                html_dir.  Use _alias#_* to point to additional directories
@                to look in.  Last one wins.   So, for example, to override
@                some of the icons in mh/web/graphics, use html_alias2_graphics
@                as a 2nd graphics parm.
@                Another example, to override some of the pages in mh/web/ia5/security,
@                use 'html_alias2_ia5 = /misterhouse/web/ia5', then create
@                /misterhouse/web/ia5/security with the file(s) to override.

@ http_port:

@    If using something other than 80 (because you already have a web server
@    running), add :port to url (e.g.  http://localhost:8080)

@ http_fork:

@    This helps avoid mh pauses, especially with remote/slow web clients.
