# you do not want to retrieve the html, simply start the
# Process_Item with a do_nothing override:
#
#  $get_url = new Process_Item "get_url http://misterhouse.sf.net temp.html";
#  start $get_url              if said $normal_usage;
#  start $get_url 'do_nothing' if said $test_usage;
#  &parse_html if done_now $get_url;
