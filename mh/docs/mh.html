<STRONG>mh</STRONG> - MisterHouse Home Automation Program

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>
<STRONG>mh</STRONG> is a perl program for time, event, web, socket, and voice based home
control functions. It currently runs on Windows 95/98/NT and on Unix
platforms, including Linux.

</P>
<P>
perl objects are used for various types of objects to give a powerful but
concise programming interface. Here is some example code:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   $dishwasher = new X10_Item 'B1';         # B1 is the dishwasher X10 code 
   set $dishwasher ON if time_now '10:30 PM';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   speak &quot;I am now closing the curtains at $Time_Now&quot; if time_now &quot;$Time_Sunset + 0:15&quot;; 
   speak &quot;The time is $Time_Now&quot; if time_cron '30,35,40,45,50 6 * * 1-5'; 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   play(file =&gt; 'stairs_creek*.wav') if state_now $movement_sensor eq ON;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   $v_bedroom_curtain = new Voice_Cmd '[open,close] the bedroom curtains';
   curtain_on('bedroom', $state) if $state = said $v_bedroom_curtain;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Usage_Options">Usage Options</A></H2>
<P>
<STRONG>mh</STRONG> [options] [files]

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>options</STRONG> are controlled in the mh\bin\mh.ini file. You can override the default
mh.ini parameters in a 'private' parm file and point to that with a
mh_parms environmental variable. 

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>files</STRONG> is a list of members in the -code_dir that you want to run. The default is
to run all .pl files.

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Usage_Examples">Usage Examples</A></H2>
<P>
These give the help text:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh -h
   mh -help
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This is the normal usage:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This will only run the 3 specified members:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh items.pl test1.pl test2.pl
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This will disable the tk interface and change the code dir to the Bruce
directory:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh -tk 0 -code_dir c:\mh\code\Bruce
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This will log all 'print' statements to /mh/test1.log and turn on all
serial related debug messages:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   mh -log_file test1.log -debug serial
</PRE>

<P>
Items and events are defined by using your favorite text editor and
creating members of perl code in a directory of your choice. For example,
all the code that runs my house is in the /mh/code/bruce directory.  

</P>
<P>
After starting mh, in addition to the timed, serial, or X10 based events
that you defined, you can trigger mh actions with any of the following:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - Voice commands.  On Windows platforms, you can use the MSVOICE icon in your tray 
    (the green V) to control the Voice Recognition (VR) mode (manual, 
    keyword-activated, or continuous). You also select your TTS (Text To Speech) 
    voice with MSVOICE.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>    On Unix platforms you can use the Festival TTS engine and pick among different
    accents and languages.  On Linux, you can install IBM's ViaVoice SDK 
    to enable Voice Recognition. 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - A web browser pointed to <A HREF="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</A> .  In addition to several
    example web interfaces, if you are familiar with HTML, you can write your 
    own customized interface.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - Typing any voice command in a telnet window.  This is customizable
    with the telnet.pl module.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - Typing any voice command in the command box in the mh tk gui window.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - Typing any voice command from a dos box, using the mh/bin/house command
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - Having any program write voice commands to the 'xcmd_file' (see mh.ini)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  - Triggering on user defined Socket or Serial port events.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Here are the basic steps of the mh program:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   1: Read config files and initialize things
 
       Setup the OLE Text To Speech (TTS) object or Festival socket port
       Setup the OLE Voice Recognition object or socket to the viavoice_server on linux
       Setup the serial objects 
       Setup the tcp socket ports
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   2: Read and evaluate/compile the user event code into the mh_temp.user_code file:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>       Optional *.mht files are processed by mh/lib/read_table_*.pl, creating *.mhp files
       Objects are evaluated and created. 
       Everything else is put into a &amp;user_loop function (at the end of mh_temp.user_code file).
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   3: Loop until exit, each pass executing:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>       Set global time/date variables 
       Check for voice commands 
       Read/write socket data 
       Read/write serial data 
       Check for timers actions 
       Check for external command files 
       Evaluate the &amp;user_loop function 
       Sleep for a while (default is 100 milliseconds), so mh does not hog the cpu.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The interpreted nature of perl allows us to change/add/delete an event
member quickly, without re-starting mh. After changing code, you tell mh to
re-load the user event code (step 2 above). If there is a syntax error with
the new code, the previous version of the code is re-loaded.

</P>
<P>
Re-loading 20 event members with 1500 lines of event code takes about 2
seconds. With a 50 millisecond sleep time, mh takes about 2-&gt;5% of the
cpu and loops about 18 times per second on our our 150 MHz PPro system.

</P>

<P>
There is lots of good perl info is at <A
HREF="http://www.perl.com">http://www.perl.com</A> . The reference book is
``Programming Perl, 2nd edition'' by Larry Wall, Tom Christensen, &amp;
Randall Schwartz. ISBN 1-56592-149-6. It is available from <A
HREF="http://www.oreilly.com">http://www.oreilly.com</A> . ``The Perl
Cookbook'' is another good book that has a ton of examples in it.

<P>
Perl can be a pretty intimidating language to learn, due to its many
options and functions, but for the purposes of using it to code mh events,
there are only a few simple rules to keep in mind. Here are a few of them:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Variables start with a $ 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Strings are quoted with ' or &quot;. Use &quot; if you want variables within 
   the string to be substituted. 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Commands end with ; 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Comments start with # 
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   You can implement block comments with =begin, =cut records, as follows:
       
      print &quot;this will run\n&quot;;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>      =begin
      print &quot;this&quot;;
      print &quot; will not run\n&quot;;
      =cut
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>      print &quot;all done\n&quot;;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Do loops start and end with { }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   If statements can be done either of the following ways:
   
      if (test) {action} 
      action if test;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   If tests are == (or !=) for numeric data and eq (or ne) for string data.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Object methods can be specified 2 ways.
   Here are both examples on how use the method 'set' for an X10 object:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>      set $dishwasher ON;    # Indirect object form
      $dishwasher-&gt;set(ON);  # Classic 'object oriented' form
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Regular expressions are used to parse strings.  They are very powerful
   and can be quite complex, but here are a few simple rules:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>      They are triggered with the =~ operator
      By default, they are delimited with //
      .  stands for any character (including blanks)
      \S stands for non blank characters (\s is for blanks)
      \d stands for digits
      * is a modifier that means 'zero or more of the previous type of character'
      + is a modifier that means 'one  or more of the previous type of character'
      ? is a modifier that means 'zero or one  of the previous type of character'
      () captures whatever is inside for use via $1, $2, $3, etc
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   For example:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>    $data = 'Mar 25, 1998 - 11:53 AM EST / 1998.03.25 1653 UTC';
    $date = $1, $year = $2, $time = $3 if $data =~ /(.+), (\d\d\d\d) - (.+) EST /;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>   On Windows systems, path names can use the Unix convention of / instead
   of the DOS convention of \.  You can also use \, by typically you must
   'escape it' (e.g. 'c:\\mh' instead of 'c:\mh').

You can get the ActiveHome kit for <CODE>$50</CODE> from at <A
HREF="http://www.x10.com">http://www.x10.com</A> . This includes a 2 way
X10 CM11 interface a lamp module and a couple of remote controllers. They
also sell the CM17 firecracker interface which mh supports, but is a one
way interface only (does not receive X10 signals).

</P>
<P>
X10.com also sells a <CODE>$50</CODE> IR transimiter that works through the
CM17 interface. Info is at <A
HREF="http://www.x10.com/products/ux17a_bj2.htm.">http://www.x10.com/products/ux17a_bj2.htm.</A>
This is supported via the mh IR_Item object.

. This controler does 2 way X10, 2 way IR, 24 digital IO, and can output
its menus to TV. See member mh/code/public/test_homevision.pl for example
code.

</P>
<P>
The DSC_Alarm.pm module supports the DSC PC5400 serial printer interface.
This module prints all events that DSC logs to the even buffer. These
events include arms/disarms/alarms, user <CODE>code(s)</CODE> that
performed <CODE>action(s),</CODE> installer access, etc. DSC does not log
individual zone open/close nor 'entry chime' events. See the
mh/lib/DSC_Alarm.pm for further information. See also the DSC_Alarm item
below.

</PRE>
</P>
<P>
In addition to the mh/code/bruce/irman.html code, there there is free
winamp, windows, and linux software for it. The schematics that it is built
from are also posted on the net (elsewhere), but for $30, it hardly seems
worth building it from scratch.

Here are 2 LCD displays with programable serial interfaces:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  <A HREF="http://www.crystalfontz.com/products/634/index.html">http://www.crystalfontz.com/products/634/index.html</A>  $60
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  <A HREF="http://linuxcentral.com">http://linuxcentral.com</A>  $80 ($101 with keypad interface)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The first display is a bit newer, bigger, brighter, cheaper. But the second
one has a version that include a 4x4 keypad interface (keypad available
from DigiKey for $20). Both are 4 lines x 20 characters (they also have a
4x40, but no keypad interface). I ordered the 2nd one from linuxcentral,
with a keypad from <A
HREF="http://www.digikey.com">http://www.digikey.com</A> (pn CKN6011-ND or
GH5010-ND). A comparison of the 2, plus some nifty linux software for them,
can be found at <A
HREF="http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net">http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net</A>

</P>
<P>
An example on how to use these displays is in mh/code/bruce/lcdproc.pl. See
the header of that file for more info.

</P>
<P>
Using a these devices, and a new MP3 perl module/player, we should be able
to build ourselves a mh based home MP3 Stereo! Someone has already built a
perl base one at <A
HREF="http://aelix.cs.iastate.edu/lcdat/">http://aelix.cs.iastate.edu/lcdat/</A>


</P>
<P>
Here are a few other devices which look useful, but have not had code
written for them:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> <A HREF="http://www.nirvis.com/">http://www.nirvis.com/</A>  $180 2-way IR device

</P>
<P>
<PRE> <A HREF="http://www.cc-concepts.com/">http://www.cc-concepts.com/</A>  iButton DigiLock interface as electronic keychain
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The Serial_Item object can read and write to any serially connect device.
There is example code in the code/public directory that shows how to
interface to a ham radio TNC receiver to decode and track a GPS
transmitters position.  

</P>
<P>
Byterunner offers lots of types of serial cards: <A

<P>
There is also now a new WMR-918, which is a wireless version, available for
about $350. An mh interface is being worked on.

</P>
<P>
iButton is a family of devices that can all talk to a '1 wire' interface.
Here are some urls and prices:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  <A HREF="http://www.ibutton.com">http://www.ibutton.com</A> (pick shop online)
    - $15 DS9097U-009 or -S09 + DS1402D-DR8l for the serial interface
      Note:  The DS9097, DS9097E, or parallel port adaptors will not work with mh
    -  $3 DS1990A-F5  for 64 bit ID buttons.
 
  <A HREF="http://www.pointsix.com">http://www.pointsix.com</A>
    - They also sell the $15 interface (under iButton Products) 
    - $10 for a 1 port relay card
    - $10 for a 2 port digital input or ouptut card
    - $6  for a 1820 temperature sensor

If you want more reliable VR without having to use a headset, you can try
these to digital array microphones:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> - Labtec LVA-7280 ClearVoice Digital Microphone ($130)
   <A HREF="http://www.labtec.com/product/family.cfm?CategoryID=2">http://www.labtec.com/product/family.cfm?CategoryID=2</A>
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> - Andrea Desktop array DA-400 ($150)
   <A HREF="http://www.andreaelectronics.com">http://www.andreaelectronics.com</A>
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The Labtec has a push button on top to turn it on and off and a red/green
LED that blinks green when sound is heard. The Andrea has a slide switch on
the side to turn it on and off. The Andrea has a bit clearer sound and is
about 2/3 the size. Having a hardware switch to disable VR is handy.

</P>
<P>
Both of these mikes are ment to be used when you are at the desktop. The
idea is that they filter out background noise better, so you can use them
in slightly noise environments, where headsets were normally required.

</P>
<P>
Can process data from a keyboard simulator scanner, like the Cue Cat

</P>
<P>
The mh/code/test/barcode* members code will process data from the Cue Kat
keyboard simulator barcode scanner, which you can pick up for free at Radio
Shack. The manufacture of the Cue Kat prefers that you use their software
(thats why they give it away), and if you want to look up data on the web
for an item, their software is probably best, as they have a large databse
of UPC codes. If, however, you want to use the scanner for some sort of
home inventory purpose, their software does not do that. The problem is
that if you use their software, you must agree to a Licence that says you
will only use the scanner with their software. Hopefully they will not
notice or care that small group of us HA guys are using it without their
software (other people who have written similar code have gotten
cease-and-desist letters).

The complete list of valid startup options is in the mh.ini file. Here are
a few of the more important ones and their defaults:

</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_code_dir">code_dir=\mh\code\test</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Points to the directory that has the user code files in it.

<P>
Use 80 if you want to use the normal web port (i.e. <A

Use 23 to enable access via 'telnet localhost', if you are running the
mh/code/testtelnet.pl member. If you use a different port, you can still
get to the port with 'telnet localhost port_number'.

</P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_diagnostics">diagnostics=1</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Set this (or w=1) to enable perl -w warning messages on potential code
errors. mh runs about 10% slower with this option on.

</P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_run">run=perl_script</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This parms allow the compile mh.exe to act as a general purpose perl
interpreter, so we can run any arbitrary perl script, without having to
have perl installed. See the get_weather.bat, get_tv_grid.bat, or
set_clock.bat files for examples. This also allows is to use the mh run
command to spawn a separate mh process to run longer running perl steps,
even if we do not have perl installed. A Win32 'fork' command would be
cleaner, but alas, no forks.

You can use the -debug and -log and options to turn on debug and/or log the
console errata to a file. For example:

</P>
<P>

<P>
Use time_start and time_stop to run mh in 'fast test mode', useful for
debugging events. The time_increment parm sets how many simulated seconds
to increment per pass. Default is 60. If only time_start is specified,
normal mode will resume when the current time is reached. If time_stop is
specified, mh will exit when reached. These parameters can be any time/date
string, as recognized by the time_now function (see docs)

<P>
Same as Serial_Item, except the 'X' prefix is prepended, to indicate an X10
command, and it has pre-defined states 'on', 'off'. 'brighten', 'dim', and
'+5'-&gt;'+95 and '-5'-&gt;'-95'. The +-## states increase/decrease
brightness by ## percent.

</P>
<P>
You can specify a 2nd argument, if you are using more than one X10
interface and you want to control an X10_Item with a specific interface.
For example, if you want to control the local module on a RF Transeiver,
you can tell mh to use the RF CM17 interface, like this:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>    $test_light = new X10_Item('A1', 'CM17');
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Note that the X10 device code is numbered 1-&gt;9,A-&gt;G. For example
device 16 in house code P would be PG.

</P>
<P>
If a single character is use (e.g. <CODE>X10_Item('D')),</CODE> then 'on'
and 'off' states are translated to ALL_ON and ALL_OFF commands for that
house code. For example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   $v_test_lights = new Voice_Cmd(&quot;All lights [on,off]&quot;);
   $test_lights   = new X10_Item(&quot;O&quot;);
   set $test_lights $state if $state = said $v_test_lights;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This item also has a built in timer with the set_with_timer method. For
example, this event will turn on a on a warning light to 20% for 5 seconds:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   set_with_timer $watchdog_light '20%', 5 if file_unchanged $watchdog_file;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If you have one of the newer (more expensive) LM14A/PLM21 2 way X10 pro
lamp modules, you can tell mh to send an extended X10 codes that let them
be set directly to a specific brightness level using a Preset Dim extended
code. The older modules can only be brightened/dimed.

</P>
<P>
The 64 extened X10 Preset Dim codes can used most easily by using the '#%'
state. Note this differs from the +-# states described above, which
increase/decrease brightness relative to the current state. The #% state
goes directly to that level, independent of the existing state.

</P>
<P>
To use the #% preset dim states, you need to use a 3rd argument on X10_Item
to tell it that you have a LM14 lamp module (the only module that currently
supports Preset Dim). For example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  $test_light2 = new X10_Lamp('O7', 'CM11', 'LM14');
  $v_test_light2 = new Voice_Cmd(&quot;Set test light to [on,off,bright,dim,5%,10%,20%,30%,40%,50%,60%,70%,80%,90%]&quot;);
  set $test_light2 $state if $state = said $v_test_light2;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
You can also use them directly, using &amp;P## (## = 1-&gt;64) as shown in
this example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  $test_light1 = new X10_Item('O7');
  $v_test_light1 = new Voice_Cmd(&quot;Set test light to [on,off,bright,dim,&amp;P3,&amp;P10,&amp;P30,&amp;P40,&amp;P50,&amp;P60]&quot;);
  set $test_light1 $state if $state = said $v_test_light1;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
There is another set of Preset Dim commands that are used by some modules
(e.g. the RCS TX15 thermostate). These 32 non-extended Preset Dim codes can
be coded directly, using the following table:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15   PRESET_DIM1

<PRE>        $command can be a simple string (e.g. 'What time is it') or it can 
        include a list of 'states' (e.g. 'Turn the light [on,off]').  The state
        enumeration group is a comma delimited string surrounded with [].
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>        In addition to one state enumeration group, you can specify any number

The first time you send a message, mh will pause for a few seconds while it
logs onto AIM or a jabber server. Subsequent messages use the same signon,
so are sent much faster.

jabber is XML based and very flexable.

The set_password command is used to create and check this password. If you

You can modify what the Tk window displays by modifying the tk_frame.pl and
tk_widgets.pl members. tk_frame.pl controls the general layout and size of
the various scrolled lists. Modifying this member takes a little knowledge
of perl Tk.  

</P>
<P>
tk_widgets.pl shows how you can add widgets to display various info and
allow for buttons for manual control. The mh tk_xxx subroutines used here
will add widgets to either the menu_bar or to the 'grid' frame defined in
tk_frame.pl.

</P>
<P>
Any change to tk_frame.pl or tk_widgets will be evaluated on a code reload,
as will the tk_geometry parm in mh.ini.

</P>
<P>
tk_xxx widgets can be added anywhere in your mh code, not just the
tk_widgets.pl member. See the weather_monitor.pl, internet_mail.pl, and
tk_eye.pl members in mh/code/bruce for examples.

</P>
<P>
The tk_xxx widgets are 'packed' into the menu_bar or grid in the order that
they are evaluated. You can use the 'Position' directive at the top of your
member.pl code to control this. Position=1 is reserved for the tk_frame.pl
member, as this must be evaluated first.

</P>
<P>
Note, you can also use native Perl tk commands, or create or override the
tk_xxx subroutines in your own code for more flexibility.

You can write your own Web page interface. The examples under mh/web are

mh-generated html frames.  

</P>
<P>
You can use the html_root and html_file mh.ini parms to point to the
directory and default web page. The html_default parm are the member names
used when the URL points to a directory.

</P>
<P>
The html_style mh.ini parm points to a style sheet that will be loaded for
all mh-generated pages. Style sheets allow default control of colors and
fonts.

</P>
<P>
There are other, html_* parms in the mh.ini file to control how the
auto-generated html data looks. For example, you can control table sizes
and auto refresh rates. See the mh.ini file for more info.

</P>
<P>
If you want to enable MsAgent support, use the mh.ini html_msagent_script*
parm. MsAgent allows remote IE web browsers to do TTS and VR on the remote
box. Note, you can do this even if you are running mh on a linux box as
long as your remote box is running IE. To enable, add the new mh.ini
html_msagent_script* parms that points to a mh/web file with the agent code
(currently only Jeff's miniJeff agent is available). Then click on the
MSAgent checkbox at the top of the Web menu to turn him on or off.

<P>
The web Items and Groups displays will use icons to indicate the object
state. Icons will be searched for in the mh/graphics directory according to
the objects icon method, the object name, the object state, and the object
type. For example, given this code:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>    $fountain = new X10_Appliance('C3');
    set_icon $fountain 'water';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The search order for the ON state will be:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>    water-on.gif
    fountain-on.gif
    x10_appliance-on.gif
    on.gif  
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The web Category display will try to match icons to Voice_Cmd objects using
the icon method, object name, voice command text, and filename. For
example, given this code from the member internet_data.pl:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> $v_set_clock = new  Voice_Cmd('Set the clock via the internet');
 set_icon $v_set_clock 'time';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The search order will be:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> Look for icons that match time
 Look for icons that match set_clock
 Look for icons that match words in 'Set the clock via the internet'
 Look for icons that match internet_data.pl
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
All icons in the graphics directory are compared to each of the above. The
first match (by search order) is used. If there are multiple matches, the
match with the longest word is used. For example, if we had icons names
'clock.gif' and 'internet.gif' (but no 'time.gif'), 'internet.gif' would be
used.

</P>
<P>
In all of the above examples, .gif was used as an example, but any browser
compatable graphics file can be used (e.g. .png and .jpg). If you want to
add new icons, some good sources are at <A
HREF="http://www.freegraphicland.com/">http://www.freegraphicland.com/</A>

</P>
<P>
Important note: If you do play with adding/deleteing/renaming icons, you
will want to do a reload before refreshing your browser. The icon directory
is cached by mh (for efficiency). If no code has changed, the reload will
run very quickly.

If you want to generate your own html on-the-fly (like a cgi program
would), instead of pointing to a .html file or or one of the above
pre-defined mh-generated lists, point to a .pl file and have that perl code
return the desired html. Note, this currently differs from how a classic
cgi program would work (they return the html as STDOUT). Some examples of
this can be found in the mh/web/test/*.pl files.    

</P>
<P>
One other note on .pl web files. You can have them use variables you define
in your mh user code, but only if those variables are defined with ``use
vars '$my_var1', '$my_var2'''. Variables defined with ``my ($my_var1,
$my_var2)'' are local only to the mh loop, and would not be available to
any web .pl program.

</P>
<P>
In addition to calling the above mh-generated html directly, you can embed
these lists in your own html using the server-side-include syntax. If the
extention on your html is .shtml (for server-side html) then mh will parse
the html, looking for the following string:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;!--#include file=&quot;your_directive&quot;--&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Anytime the above string is found, it will replace that record with
whatever you specify in ``your_directive''. ``your_directive'' can either
be another html (or shtml) file, or it can be one of the mh-generated lists
from above. For example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;!--#include file=&quot;/mh/other_links.html&quot;--&gt;
  &lt;!--#include file=&quot;category&quot;--&gt;
  &lt;!--#include file=&quot;/mh_default/test/test1.pl&quot;--&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
You can use an #include var= directive, like file= above except it returns
the contents of an mh variable. For example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Version:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;!--#include var=&quot;$Version&quot;--&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This what is used in the mh 'About' web button to return the mh version.

</P>
<P>
You can also define your own functions in your code files to return html,
and then call them with the code= include directive. For example, add these
to any of your code files:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  sub web_func1 {
      return &quot;uptime = &quot; . &amp;time_diff($Time_Startup_time,$Time , undef, 'numeric');
  }
  sub web_func2 {
      return &quot;results from function 2&quot;; 
  }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Then call them like this:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> &lt;p&gt;Test web functions
 &lt;!--#include code=&quot;&amp;web_func1&quot;--&gt;
 &lt;!--#include code=&quot;&amp;web_func2&quot;--&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
One useful built in function is &amp;dir_index, which can be used to create
a directory listing of files in selected directories. For example, if you
have a web directory called pictures, create an index.shtml file, and
include the following line: &lt;!--#include
code=``&amp;dir_index('/pictures','name',0)''--&gt;

</P>
<P>
You can have <CODE>&amp;dir_index</CODE> sort by name, type, size, or date.
Set the 3rd argument to 1 for reverse sort order. See
mh/web/graphics/index.shtml for an example.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have only a few specific html controls, you can write your
own html using the RUN, SET, and SET_VAR url keywords to control mh. Here
are a few examples:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> &lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/SET">http://localhost:8080/SET</A>?$test_lights?off &gt;Turn the test light off&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/SET_VAR">http://localhost:8080/SET_VAR</A>?$Save{test_input1}?abc &gt;Load test_input1 with abc&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/RUN?WebCam_light_on">http://localhost:8080/RUN?WebCam_light_on</A> &gt;WebCam light on&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The SET command can set any object defined in your user code to a valid
state. The SET_VAR command can set a variable or an object (child of
Generic_Object) to any arbitrary value. The RUN command can run any voice
command. Use '_' to replace blanks in the command string.

</P>
<P>
SET, SET_VAR, and RUN can use an optional response field to decide what
html will be returned:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  Format:
   SET_VAR:h_response?$var?value
   SET:h_response?object?value
   RUN:h_response?command
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  Where h_response can be one of the following:
   &amp;function       The results of &amp;function will be returned
   &amp;function(arg)  The results of &amp;function(arg) will be returned
   last_response   The last displayed or spoken text. 
   last_displayed  The last displayed text will be returned
   last_spoken     The last spoken item will be returned
   filexyz.html    The contents of filexyz.html will be returned
   string          string will be returned
   Referer         The browser will be re-directed back to the calling page
   <A HREF="http://url">http://url</A>      The browser will be re-directed to url
   blank:          A list of recently spoken text will be returned
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Here are some examples demonstrating these options:

</P>
<P>
<PRE> This returns the last spoken line:
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/RUN:last_spoken?WebCam_light_on">http://localhost:8080/RUN:last_spoken?WebCam_light_on</A> &gt;Light on&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This returns the string &quot;Thanks for playing&quot;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/RUN:Thanks_for_playing?WebCam_light_off">http://localhost:8080/RUN:Thanks_for_playing?WebCam_light_off</A> &gt;Light off&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This returns the contents of the mh/web/test/test3.html file:
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/RUN:test/test3.html?WebCam_light_+50">http://localhost:8080/RUN:test/test3.html?WebCam_light_+50</A> &gt;+50&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This returns a list of recently spoken text:
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/RUN?WebCam_light_-50">http://localhost:8080/RUN?WebCam_light_-50</A> &gt;-50&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This will allow for text input, using a html FORM, and returning the the results form
 the user defined function &amp;my_response:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;FORM ACTION=&quot;SET_VAR:&amp;my_response&quot;&gt;Test 1&lt;INPUT SIZE=5 NAME=&quot;$Save{test_input1}&quot;&lt;/form&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This will set a $barcode_scan Generic_Item, then display a web page 
 that was updated by user code:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;FORM ACTION=&quot;SET_VAR:barcode_search.html&quot;  target='speech'&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Scan data into here: &lt;INPUT SIZE=60 NAME=&quot;$barcode_scan&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/FORM&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This will redirect the browser back to the calling page:
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;a HREF=&quot;<A HREF="http://misterhouse.net:8080/SET:Referer">http://misterhouse.net:8080/SET:Referer</A>?$camera_light&amp;on&quot;&gt;Light on&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE> This will redirect the browser to misterhouse.net
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;a HREF=&quot;<A HREF="http://misterhouse.net:8080/SET:http://misterhouse.net">http://misterhouse.net:8080/SET:http://misterhouse.net</A>?$camera_light&amp;off&quot;&gt;Light off&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
You can also use RUN:h_response without a command. For example, if you want
to get a directory listing, sorted by date (recent on top):

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;a href=<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/RUN:&amp">http://localhost:8080/RUN:&amp</A>;dir_index('/pictures','date',1)&gt;List pictures by date &lt;/a&gt;

If you want to use a program generated list in an Item declaration, you
need to use add # noloop=start/stop comments before and after the code that

</P>

<PRE>  # noloop=start
  my $mp3names;
  while ( my $mp3name = &lt;d:/library/*.m3u&gt; )
   {
    $mp3name =~ s#^.*/##;  # remove path
    $mp3name =~ s#\..*$##; # remove extension
    $mp3names .= &quot;,&quot; if $mp3names;

If you want to have a user defined function called once perl loop, but you
want it before or after all the other user code has been called, use the
<CODE>&amp;MainLoop_pre_add_hook</CODE> and
<CODE>&amp;MainLoop_post_add_hook</CODE> functions to add callbacks to your
functions. For example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  $v_hook_pre_add   = new Voice_Cmd 'Add  pre  code hook';
  $v_hook_pre_drop  = new Voice_Cmd 'Drop pre  code hook';
  $v_hook_post_add  = new Voice_Cmd 'Add  post code hook';
  $v_hook_post_drop = new Voice_Cmd 'Drop post code hook';
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &amp;MainLoop_pre_add_hook(  \&amp;test_hook_pre)  if said $v_hook_pre_add;
  &amp;MainLoop_pre_drop_hook( \&amp;test_hook_pre)  if said $v_hook_pre_drop;
  &amp;MainLoop_post_add_hook( \&amp;test_hook_post) if said $v_hook_post_add;
  &amp;MainLoop_post_drop_hook(\&amp;test_hook_post) if said $v_hook_post_drop;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>  sub test_hook_pre  { print &quot;&lt;&quot;; }
  sub test_hook_post { print &quot;&gt;&quot;; }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If you want your hook code to last between code reloads (e.g. added by
startup code from a module), set the persistant flag by passing a 1 as a
2nd argument. For example:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  &amp;main::MainLoop_post_drop_hook( \&amp;jabber::process, 1 );
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Here is a list of all the code hook locations:

</P>
<P>
<PRE>  MainLoop_pre   =&gt; Run before user code 
  MainLoop_post  =&gt; Run before user code 
  Serial_match   =&gt; Run when incoming serial data matches
  Play_pre       =&gt; Run before playing wav files
  Play_post      =&gt; Run after  playing wav files
  Speak_pre      =&gt; Run before speaking text files
  Speak_post     =&gt; Run after  speaking text files

Under windows, TK windows do not get focus and some keys and shortcuts do
not work. Worse yet, the 'tear off' line (the dashed line on the pull down

Note: if you have an old perl/tk (older than 8.0012), things are even more
messed up.
