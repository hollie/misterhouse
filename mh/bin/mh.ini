#
#        Configuration variables for MisterHouse programs
#
# Change log is at the bottom
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Rather than edit this file, create your own 'mh.private.ini' file
#      and override just the values you need to.  Then set the mh_parms
#      environmental variable to point to this file.  By default it will look 
#      for in mh/bin/mh.private.ini.
#
#         Examples on how to set environmental parms:
#
#           On Windows systems, add this to your autoexec.bat
#               set mh_parms=c:\misterhouse\mh.ini
#
#           Or set up a bat file with something like this:
#              
#              set mh_parms=c:\misterhouse\mh.ini
#              c:
#              cd \misterhouse\bin
#              mh
#
#
#           On linux   systems, add this to your /etc/profile:
#               export mh_parms=/prog/Misterhouse/mh.ini
#
#      See the 'Coding your own event' section of mh/docs/install.html for more info
#
#      By changing the following parms, you can keep the mh distributions files
#      seperate from your local files (makes upgrades easier):
#        - code_dir
#        - data_dir
#        - html_dir
#
#      You can also override any of these parameters from the command 
#      line.  For example:
#
#          mh -code_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_code
#             -data_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_data
#             -html_dir /prog/Misterhouse/my_web
#
#

# or don't want sound files played, set this to blank.
sound_program=play

#------
# Point to the html file that is used for the web interface.
# - html_dir     points to the default dir (i.e. what you get with http://localhost:8080/)
# - html_default points to the member names used when the URL points to a directory.
# - html_alias*  points to other directories that are not subdirectories of html_dir
# - html_style*  points to the Style sheets used to control fonts/colors
#
# - See \mh\web\mh\mh.html, section 'Customizing the Web Interface' for more documentation
#
# Note: As with many mh parms, if you want to quickly try most of the following,
#   you can you can use the mh reload button/function, then refresh  
#   your webpage.  You do not have to exit mh

# These password options control access to mh functions over the intra/internet

#  - password_file is the place you want to keep your encripted password.  Default
#    is data_dir/.password.  Use mh/bin/set_password to create the file
#    If this file does not exist (i.e. you have not run set_password)
#    the web server, telnet.pl, and mhsend will allow full access to everyone.
#
#  - password_allow_file is used to list commands and/or items that can be
#    controlled without password protection (e.g. demo/harmless commands).
#
#  - password_allow_clients is the (comma delimited) list of ip addresses of clients 
#    you want to bypass password protection from (e.g. boxes on your intranet)
#
#  - password_protect controls what requires a password to be displayed.
#    Possible values are:
#       all -> All of the web pages (i.e. nothing will be displayed without a password)
#       log -> The web speak and print logs.
#   widgets -> All of the widgets.
#      vars -> The Global and Save variables.
#      none -> Same as blank.  Anyone can look at all of the web pages

# Location data
#   - sunrise/set items need lat/long.  lat/long example: 44 degrees 30 minutes -> 44.5
#   - city, state, and country  are for internet weather data.
#------
# You can use http://www.mapblast.com to verify latitude and longitude
# Here is a map our neighborhood: http://www.vicinity.com/gif?&CT=44.08150:-92.50374:4000:&FAM=mapblast&
# Satalite view available via:  http://terraserver.microsoft.com/GetPageByLatLon.asp
# 
# The time_zone parm is the difference between GMT (Greenich Mean Time -- London) and your
# local time.  If running Windows, use can find the value in the the Clock Tray Time Zone.
# You can also pick it off a map time zone data at 
#   http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/faq/docs/world_tzones.html
# Use positve numbers for time_zone and for latitude 
# (e.g. use lat=+44 and time_zone=+6 instead of -44 and -6). 
# Time Zone examples:
#  - Sydney       ->  10
#  - Cairo        ->   2
#  - London       ->   0
#  - Buenos Aires ->   3
#  - USA Eastern  ->   5
#  - USA Pasific  ->   8
# After making changes here, you can run sun_time from the command line to test and verify
# with data from http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/data/docs/RS_OneYear.html
#
# Note: If you have the TZ enviromental variable set, that will override this time_zone value!

#  Labor    day:  First Monday in September
#  Thanksging:    Last Thursday in November

# voice command options
#  - Used if you want Mister House to do voice recognition and voice synthesis. 
#    See the mh/docs/install.html on how to install various speech engines.
#
#  - voice_text can be MS, festival, vvo_speak (for IBM's viavoice Outloud)

#
#  - voice_cmd  can be MS, viavoice, or blank to disable
#
#  - pronouncable_list_file:    List of words to forcibly pronounce
#
#  - If you have viavoice_server running, run the mh code member 
#    mh/code/Bruce/viavoice_control.pl to enable the following parms: 
#
#    - viavoice_host:           Point to the box viavoice is running on (currently linux only)
#                               Note:  you can have mh running on windows, and viavoice running on linux.
#
#    - viavoice_port:           Currently hard coded in viavoice_server at 3234
#
#    - viavoice_awake_phrase:   Command(s) to that will switch mh into active mode (all commands
#                               recognized) from asleep mode.
#    - viavoice_awake_response: This is what is said (or played) when entering awake mode
#    - viavoice_awake_time:     Stay in awake mode for this many seconds after the last command 
#                               was heard.  Then it switches to asleep mode. Set to 0 or blank to
#                               disable (always stay in awake mode). 
#
#    - viavoice_asleep_phrase:  Command{s} to put mh into asleep mode.
#    - viavoice_asleep_response:This is what it said (or played) when entering sleep mode
#    - viavoice_asleep_sound:   Sound or text to speak when awake_time timer switches to asleep mode. 
#
#    - viavoice_off_phrase:     Command{s} used to turn the viavoice microphone off.

# serial_ports
#  - points to the serial ports for various interfaces
#  - set to blank to disable
#  - on windows, use COM1, COM2, ... COMn 
#  - on linux, use /dev/ttyS0 for COM1, /dev/ttyS1 for COM2, etc.
#  -    Note:  To allow the port to written to by any user id, run this command as root:
#                 chmod o+w /dev/ttyS0
#
#  - Port names can be one of the following:
#       weeder_port
#       cm11_port (For X10 ActiveHome interface)
#       cm17_port (For X10 Firecracker interface)
#       HomeBase_port
#       serial#_port (# is 1 .. whatever)
#  - For generic serial#_ports:
#        handshake can be 'none' or 'dtr'
#        datatype options:
#           records -> data is split on \n (cr).  The 'said' method
#                      will return data only when a new line has been
#                      completely read.  This is the default.
#           raw     -> data is not split.  The 'said' method returns
#                      whatever has been read into the buffer when called.
#
# For those of you lucky enought to have lots of ports and unlucky enough to be on 
# an NT box, here is a pointer on using ports above 9:
#    http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q115/8/31.asp?LNG=ENG&SA=TECH&FR=1

# If you want to use the &net_domain_name function, point this to a Domain Name Server
# If you don't use this function, leave this blank and save a bit of memory and startup time.
# On Windows, you can find your DNS server under 'Control Panel->Network->TCP/IP->DNS configuration'
# Use ',' between server names.  For example:
#     DNS_server=24.2.204.33,24.2.204.34

# With this set, you can query the domain name of the last client to access the web server like so:

#
# An example of this can be found in mh/code/test/monitor_server.pl
# Note: if your DNS server is slow, this can slow mh down, as it waits for the DNS server responses.
